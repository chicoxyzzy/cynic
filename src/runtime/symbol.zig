//! `JSSymbol` — Cynic's primitive Symbol (§20.4).
//!
//! Each `JSSymbol` is a unique value. Identity is by pointer; two
//! `Symbol("x")` calls produce distinct symbols even though their
//! descriptions match. `Symbol.for(k)` interns into a per-realm
//! registry so `Symbol.for("k") === Symbol.for("k")`.
//!
//! Cynic encodes Symbols in the NaN-boxed `Value` via the
//! "tag_object" tag plus a two-bit pointer-tag (`0b10`) to
//! distinguish them from JSFunction (`0b00`) and JSObject
//! (`0b01`). See heap.zig for the bit layout.
//!
//! Spec anchors: §20.4 Symbol Objects, §6.1.5 Symbol type.
