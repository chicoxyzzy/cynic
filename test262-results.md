# test262 conformance — Cynic

**Cynic passes 90.83 % of the 49808 test262 fixtures it runs**, scored binary pass/fail under a single posture (`--unhardened --allow=eval`):

- **45241 passing** — Cynic produced the spec-expected result.
- **4567 failing** — every other scored fixture. No "expected fail" category: an Annex-B / no-Intl / strict-only / SES / eval miss counts as a plain fail, same as an engine bug. Honest, not flattering.
- **Excluded from the denominator**: the upstream `harness/` and `staging/` paths, the whole `annexB/` tree, every Stage ≤ 3 proposal (decorators, import-defer, …), and structurally-unrunnable fixtures (no / malformed frontmatter). Shipped pre-Stage-4 proposals (joint-iteration, ShadowRealm) get their own scoreboard below.

## Current scores

| posture | passing | failing | total | pass% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **`--unhardened --allow=eval`** | 45241 | 4567 | 49808 | 90.83 % |

> **pass%** = `passing / (passing + failing)`. Every scored
> fixture is a plain pass or fail — there is no "expected
> fail" reclassification and no in-corpus "skip" column.

## Legend

### Posture

One scored posture: **`--unhardened --allow=eval`**. The SES
freeze pass is off (so fixtures that monkey-patch primordials
run unhindered) and the eval surface (`eval()`,
`new Function(string)`, …) is opened so eval-dependent
fixtures run for real. The default `cynic run` posture
(hardened, eval off) is stricter; this row measures the
engine's spec coverage with the policy knobs out of the way.

### Columns

- **`passing`** — Cynic produced the spec-expected result.
- **`failing`** — every other scored fixture. An Annex B,
  no-Intl, strict-only, SES, or eval miss counts as a plain
  fail, same as an engine bug.
- **`total`** — `passing + failing`. Excludes the upstream
  `harness/` / `staging/` / `annexB/` paths, Stage ≤ 3
  proposals, and structurally-unrunnable fixtures.
- **`pass%`** — `passing / total`. The headline.
- **`Δ pass`** (history) — change in `passing` versus the
  previous row.
- **`elapsed`** (history) — wall-clock time of the run.
  Recorded only for full sweeps; partial runs leave it blank.

### Why we don't claim "spec%"

These percentages are **not** ECMA-262 spec conformance.
test262 is one community attempt at covering the spec via
concrete fixtures, and we run a filtered subset of it. So
`pass%` is right for "did anything regress?" tracking, but
it's a lower bound on spec coverage.


## What is not passing, and why

Every failure, classified. The policy classes are by-design
fails under the binary posture — fixtures that need sloppy
mode, Annex B surfaces, or ECMA-402, none of which Cynic
ships, on purpose. The **engine gaps** row is the real bug
count; the per-area table below it is the work list.

| why | failing | detail |
|---|---:|---|
| ECMA-402 not implemented | 3250 | the whole `intl402/` tree — `Intl` (and the `intl402/Temporal` twins of the excluded Temporal proposal) is an unbuilt subsystem |
| sloppy-mode-only fixtures | 1142 | `flags: [noStrict]` — Cynic is strict-only by design (`with`, sloppy direct-eval `arguments` bindings, legacy S11-era semantics, ...) |
| Annex B builtins | 69 | `__proto__` accessor + `__define`/`__lookup{Getter,Setter}__` are not shipped by design |
| cannot-block agent semantics | 2 | `flags: [CanBlockIsFalse]` — fixtures requiring `Atomics.wait` to throw on a non-blocking agent |
| **engine gaps** | 104 | failures the policy classes do not explain — the work list (an upper bound: it includes a residue of fixtures whose sloppy semantics hide inside dynamic `Function(...)` bodies, undetectable from frontmatter) |

**Failing areas.** Only areas with at least one failure are
listed (everything else passes). `gaps` is the slice of the
area's failures the policy classes above do not explain —
sorted to the top, because that column is the engine work
list. Bucketed on the first two path components.

## Pre-Stage-4 proposals shipped

Per-feature scores for the TC39 proposals Cynic ships at
Stage 1–3, ahead of their inclusion in the published edition.
Each proposal is swept in isolation (only its own
`--enable=<flag>` on) under the same single posture, scored
binary pass/fail. These fixtures are excluded from the
top-line score.

| feature | passing | failing | total | pass% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `joint-iteration` | 78 | 0 | 78 | 100 % |
| `ShadowRealm` | 63 | 1 | 64 | 98 % |
