## Legend

**Rows**

- **parser** — parses the source only. A pass means Cynic's parser accepts or rejects the test as the spec requires. The runtime is never invoked.
- **runtime** — parses, compiles, and executes. A pass means the result matches the test's expectation (no error for positive tests, the right error class for negatives).

**Columns**

- **spec%** — `pass / total`. Coverage of the corpus. Skipped tests are in `total` but never in `pass`, so this rises only when we ship features that unblock previously-skipped tests. Same definition in the rolled-up rows and in the by-area scoreboard.
- **attempted%** — `pass / (pass + fail)`. Of the tests we actually ran, the fraction that passed. Skips drop out. Measures the quality of what's shipped, independent of coverage. Same definition in the rolled-up rows and in the by-area scoreboard; skip-only buckets render as `0 %`.
- **pass / total** — raw counts. `total` is the Cynic-targeted corpus (see below); `fail` is `attempted - pass`; `skip` is `total - attempted`.
- **Δ pass** (history) — change in `pass` versus the row immediately above (chronologically previous run of the same `mode`).

**Scope.** `total` excludes paths universally out of scope (`harness/`, `staging/`, `intl402/`), Annex B language extensions, and browser-era built-ins Cynic doesn't ship (`escape` / `unescape`, `String.prototype` HTML wrappers, `Date.{getYear, setYear}`).
