# Cynic — Roadmap

_Sections below are themes, not strict timelines — many run in parallel._

## Status

Live scores, per-area breakdown, and history are in
[test262-results.md](../test262-results.md). That file is the
single source of truth; this roadmap deliberately doesn't snapshot
numbers so it can't drift.

`spec%` is `pass / total` on the Cynic-targeted corpus (excludes
universally out-of-scope paths — Annex B language extensions,
`harness/`, `staging/`, `intl402/`, browser-era built-ins).
`attempted%` is `pass / (pass + fail)` — quality of what's shipped,
ignoring skips.

`zig build test` runs all unit tests; `zig build test262 -- --quiet`
runs the conformance harness.

## Lexer & parser

**Done.**

- Strict-only `InputElement{Div,RegExp}` lexer covering the full
  punctuator set, reserved words, all numeric forms (decimal / hex /
  octal / binary / BigInt), string literals with escapes, template
  literals, hashbang, private identifiers, and `\uXXXX` / `\u{...}`
  identifier escapes. Unicode tracks UCD `latest`.
- Recursive-descent / Pratt expression parser, ASI rules 1 and 2,
  diagnostic recovery, all strict-mode early errors (`eval` / `arguments`
  bindings, `delete` of bare ident, etc.), `StrictDirective`
  recognition.
- Full §13 expression grammar: literals, atoms, member / call /
  optional-chain (`?.`), `new`, spread, tagged templates, regex
  literals, classes, generators, async functions, async generators,
  arrow functions (concise + block body), destructuring patterns
  (array, object, rest, defaults, nesting, renaming), update / unary
  / binary / logical / nullish / conditional / sequence /
  assignment + compound assignment + logical-assignment.
- §14 statement grammar including `try` / `catch` / `finally`,
  `for` / `for-in` / `for-of` / `for-await-of` (incl. lhs
  destructuring), `switch`, labeled statements, lexical
  declarations with TDZ positioning, `class` declarations,
  `function` / `function*` / `async function*` (with `yield*`
  delegation), ES6 modules (`import` / `export` / namespace
  imports / re-exports).

**In progress / on the watch.**

- Top-level `await` cycles via the full
  [[PendingAsyncDependencies]] graph (§16.2.1.5). Today's
  `module_link_complete` opcode + `pending_async_deps` slot
  covers the direct-dep and CycleRoot-via-cycle-leaf cases
  observably, but skips the [[AsyncEvaluationOrder]] sort and
  reverse `[[AsyncParentModules]]` propagation. The bucket is
  at 250 / 251 today — only fixtures that exercise the sort
  ordering will land beyond what we have. See
  [`handbook/environments.md`](handbook/environments.md).
- StringLiteral export/import names (§16.2.3.5) — `export {
  "x" as "y" }` strips quotes and treats both sides as
  identifiers; `import { "y" as local }` and `export * as
  "ns"` ship.

**Out of scope.** Annex B language extensions (no sloppy mode, no
labels-in-old-positions, no HTML-like comments, no legacy octal,
no for-in initializer); `eval` / `new Function(string)` / dynamic
code construction (aligns with SES).

## Bytecode & runtime

**Done.**

- NaN-boxed `Value` with int32 fast-path, double, bool, null,
  undefined, string, object, function, symbol, BigInt, Hole (TDZ).
- Bytecode VM with register file + accumulator, exception handler
  table, environment chains for `let` / `const` / `var` scoping,
  per-iteration env for `for` / `for-of` over `let`.
- Frames + call stack, return-completion, throw-completion,
  uncaught-throw → host. `try` / `catch` / `finally` including
  synthetic-handler for finally-on-throw and inlining of finally
  bodies on `return`.
- Functions: arrows, methods, generators, async, async generators
  (with microtask-deferred `.then` reactions and pending-promise
  yield-await chaining), bound functions, classes (constructors,
  methods, static, private fields + methods, accessors, `extends`
  / `super` / `super[expr]`).
- Object model: own data + accessor properties with descriptor
  flags, prototype chain, `[[Extensible]]`, frozen / sealed /
  prevent-extensions, integer-indexed properties, ArraySetLength
  with strict-mode failure semantics, well-known `@@`-prefixed
  symbol keys, `Symbol.toPrimitive` integration in
  `==` / `!=` / `<` / `>` / `<=` / `>=` / arithmetic operators.
- Iteration: `iter_open` opcode, generator `next` / `return` /
  `throw`, async-generator `next` returning Promises,
  `iter_close` on for-of break + return walking the loop chain.
  `yield*` delegation for sync and async generators (spec-faithful
  `IteratorClose` / `AsyncIteratorClose` on abrupt completion).
  `for-await-of` end-to-end against async iterators (§14.7.5),
  including the sync-iterable-to-async-iterable wrap.
- Optional chaining (`?.`) + nullish coalescing (`??`) +
  logical-assignment (`&&=` / `\|\|=` / `??=`) including member
  targets + computed keys.
- Argument spread in regular calls + `new` (lowered to
  `Reflect.construct`).
- Microtask queue + `await` suspension via generator-shaped frame
  saves; promise reaction queue with then / catch / finally.
- Generational mark-sweep heap (sticky-bit minors, incremental major mark + sweep), fired on allocation pressure
  — both a count trigger (`gc_threshold` allocations between
  cycles, default 16,384) and a byte trigger (`gc_byte_threshold`,
  default 16 MiB) so allocate-and-discard string concat patterns
  GC promptly. Roots: globals, intrinsics, microtask queue,
  modules, top-level chunks, active call frames, open handle
  scopes. The heap stays bounded under any allocating loop /
  recursion / promise chain. Always-on counters surface
  `bytes_alloc_total` / `bytes_live_peak` / `gc_cycles_total`
  / `gc_time_ns_total` for engine-side memory profiling via the
  harness `--mem-summary` / `--top-alloc` / `--gc-stats` flags.
  Operational details + `HandleScope` contract for natives:
  [docs/handbook/gc.md](handbook/gc.md).
- Per-test interpreter step budget — the test262 harness caps
  each fixture at 50M opcodes so a `while(true){}` can't wedge
  the sweep.

**In progress / planned.**

- **Concurrent GC marking.** The generational collector
  (young/mature split, card-marked remembered set, sticky-bit
  minors, `collectYoung` with promotion-by-relink) plus
  **incremental** major marking and lazy sweep have shipped (see the
  Performance section) — the major cycle marks behind a Dijkstra
  barrier and sweeps in safe-point slices, cutting the max GC pause
  ~800 ms → ~1 ms. The major's *mark CPU* on a large stable
  retained set is now at the non-moving floor: a generational-
  incremental major (skip re-tracing the unchanged old set) was
  explored and **closed as not viable for a non-moving collector** —
  a non-moving mark-sweep cannot reclaim old garbage without
  re-tracing it (commit efe52c7d,
  [docs/gc-generational-major.md](gc-generational-major.md)). The three
  escapes were then scoped: a region heap (**Immix**) was killed by a
  profile showing the per-object pools aren't the bottleneck
  ([docs/gc-immix-rearchitecture.md](gc-immix-rearchitecture.md)), and
  **reference counting** — the one lever that profile justified — was
  prototyped and measured a no-go (its store barrier taxes common
  operations for a narrow retained-set-only win,
  [docs/gc-reference-counting.md](gc-reference-counting.md)). The broad
  GC win is banked; only fully *concurrent* (off-thread) marking is
  unexplored, and it's a poor fit for a single-threaded mutator — the
  broad perf frontier is the JIT.
- **GC trigger at every safe-point — the pure-native residual.**
  The allocation-pressure check (`gc_threshold` / `gc_byte_threshold`)
  fires at every interpreter safe-point: each bytecode loop back-edge
  AND the first opcode of every `runFrames` entry (interpreter.zig
  `runSafePoint`). So a microtask-driven JS storm — e.g. a self-deferring
  `.then` chain that re-defers and never returns to a JS loop — already
  self-throttles: each reaction is a fresh `runFrames` entry that crosses
  the entry safe-point (verified — a 400-step self-deferring storm runs
  ~25 minor cycles mid-drain, heap bounded; `realm_test.zig`). The
  residual is a *pure-native* allocation storm that never re-enters the
  interpreter — a native builtin looping over user-sized input, or a
  reaction with no JS handler — which crosses no safe-point; those are
  bounded per-builtin by the host-safety checklist rather than a global
  trigger, so a drain-boundary check is belt-and-suspenders rather than a
  correctness gap. V8 / SpiderMonkey / JSC scavenge when the nursery fills
  regardless of context; a microtask-drain-boundary check (and other
  native re-entry points) would close the residual uniformly if a native
  path is ever found to grow unbounded. A companion harness fix: a real
  timer queue in `tools/test262.zig` so the test262 `setTimeout` polyfill
  resolves a delay by wall-clock instead of busy-spinning (what `d8` /
  `jsc` / Node give the runner). Both were surfaced landing the
  `$262.agent` cross-agent `waitAsync` fixtures, whose parent busy-loops
  on exactly this pattern.

**Recently landed (was in progress; now done).**

- **SES baseline by default — frozen primordials + override-
  mistake fix.** `intrinsics.freezePrimordials` runs as the last
  step of `installBuiltins` when `realm.hardened` is true (the
  default). Two passes: a `hardenWalk` over `globalThis` + every
  reachable intrinsic stamps `[[Extensible]] = false` and locks
  every descriptor `{writable: false, configurable: false}`
  (accessors: `{configurable: false}`); then a Phase 3 pass
  demotes each prototype's own data slot to a synthetic accessor
  pair so `Foo.prototype.toString = fn` succeeds as instance
  shadowing on `Foo.prototype` instead of throwing per §10.1.9.2's
  override-mistake reject. Constructors, namespace objects
  (`Math`, `JSON`, `Reflect`), and `globalThis` itself stay as
  frozen data slots — direct intrinsic mutation
  (`Array = …`, `Math.PI = 4`) still throws. The whole SES
  posture toggles atomically with `--unhardened`; `--allow=eval`
  stays separate because it carries compile-time optimization-
  fence cost. Multi-realm is partial but solid — per-function
  `[[Realm]]` (set at allocation), realm-aware resolution (a
  running function resolves its free globals — read + write —,
  its Error-constructor and §23.1.3.34 species intrinsics, and
  primitive boxing through its OWN realm, not the caller's),
  cross-realm species, and `ShadowRealm` (constructor +
  `.evaluate` + `.importValue` + the §3.8.3.4 callable boundary)
  all ship, the shared-heap GC marks every coexisting realm's
  roots (closing a cross-realm use-after-free), and a collected
  `ShadowRealm` frees its child realm record (per-realm teardown).
  Full Compartments are **postponed pending the TC39 proposal**: it's
  Stage 1 ([tc39/proposal-compartments](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments)),
  so the API is still in flux and Cynic doesn't bake pre-Stage-4
  surface into its confinement boundary — the multi-realm substrate
  Compartments stand on already largely ships. The test262 sweep
  scores both modes — the
  `unhardened` row tracks the legacy ECMAScript baseline (the
  `--unhardened` opt-out), the `hardened` row tracks the
  SES posture. Brand bet
  delivered: Cynic ships the SES baseline natively, no
  `@endo/ses` import or `lockdown()` call required. Design +
  phase notes in [docs/ses-alignment.md](ses-alignment.md).

- **`harden()` global** — Phase 2 of the SES-by-default
  shopping list (`aed6a66`). Native recursive deep-freeze on
  `globalThis`, cycle-safe via a heap-pointer visited set.
  Reused by the Phase 1 freeze pass (`hardenWalk` is the same
  walker). See [docs/ses-alignment.md](ses-alignment.md) for
  the acknowledged corner-case gaps (module namespaces, Proxy
  trap routing, recursion depth).

- **§9.10 KeepDuringJob for WeakRef** (`d791920`). Both the
  `WeakRef` constructor (§26.1.1.1 step 4) and
  `WeakRef.prototype.deref` (§26.1.4.1 step 2a) call
  AddToKeptObjects(target), pinning the target in a per-agent
  [[KeptAlive]] list. `Realm.kept_alive` holds the list; the
  GC marker walks it as a strong root.
  `lantern.drainMicrotasks` calls ClearKeptObjects at start +
  after each drained microtask (§9.5.5 — each microtask is its
  own job). Closes a documented spec gap: previously
  `ref.deref()` twice in the same synchronous block could see
  a swept target on Cynic, observably different from
  V8 / JSC / SpiderMonkey.

- **Proper Tail Calls (PTC) — §15.10.** Two new opcodes
  (`tail_call`, `tail_call_method`) plus a static
  IsInTailPosition pass in the bytecode compiler: an inherited
  `in_tail_position` flag propagates through `ReturnStatement`,
  `ArrowFunction` concise body, parenthesized, conditional
  consequent / alternate, logical `&&` / `||` / `??` rhs, and
  comma's last operand; every other expression type clears it
  for its sub-expressions. The runtime handler reuses the
  current `CallFrame` in place — overwriting chunk / ip / env /
  this / registers — so `return f(n - 1)` recurses without
  growing the dispatch stack. The §15.10.1 disqualifiers Cynic
  honors: enclosing try-with-finally, try-with-catch in the
  same chunk, open for-of iterator owing `IteratorClose`, async
  / generator body. Exotic callees (proxy, bound, native,
  generator, async) fall back to ordinary call semantics — the
  unconditionally-emitted follow-up `return_` propagates the
  result. **On by default** (no feature flag) — Cynic is the
  second engine shipping spec-mandated PTC alongside
  JavaScriptCore. ~30 test262 fixtures under `language/*/tco-*`
  and the `tail-call-optimization` feature tag now pass.

- **Monomorphic property cache — `lda_property` + `sta_property`
  + `call_method`.** Three opcodes grew a `u16` IC operand and a
  chunk-local typed load/store cache plus `inline_call_caches`; the
  fast path is a single pointer compare against the cached
  receiver shape (or callee) and a direct `slots[slot]` load /
  write. Backed by the existing shape transition tree (V8 /
  JSC / SM lineage). Measured on `bench/micros/`: `prop_access`
  −66 % (48.94 → 16.47 ms), `prop_write` −63 % (92.24 → 33.70 ms).
  Polymorphic chain dispatch is the natural follow-up, deferred
  until a workload surfaces a hot polymorphic site.

- **GC — mark-colour flip replaces per-cycle clear loop.** Each
  heap kind carries a `mark_color: u1` instead of `marked: bool`;
  the cycle-start `live_color` flip ages every existing object's
  `mark_color` to "unmarked" automatically. Eliminates seven
  linear walks over the mature set per minor cycle. V8 ships
  this inside `MarkingState`, SpiderMonkey in `MarkingTracer`,
  JSC's Riptide uses the same idea. Plus: registered symbols
  (`Symbol.for("k")`) now pin at registration time — the per-
  cycle re-mark loop over `symbol_registry` is gone too. The
  `cynic` CLI gained `--gc-threshold=<n>` (parity with the
  test262 harness flag), so `cynic --gc-threshold=1 run foo.js`
  runs a stress sweep without going through the harness.

- **"Everything but RegExp" sweep — May 2026** moved Cynic from
  89.39 % to 91.48 % spec / 93.51 % to 98.52 % attempted (+847
  pass). Buckets fully cleared: top-level-await, WeakSet,
  Math.sumPrecise (Stage 4 shipped), JSON/isRawJSON (Stage 4
  shipped), Object.prototype.valueOf, Object.fromEntries,
  dynamic-import/catch, statements + expressions/async-
  generator, compound-assignment, logical-assignment,
  Array.from, Array.of, String.fromCharCode, built-ins/global,
  class/elements, AsyncFromSyncIterator, Reflect.set,
  Proxy.ownKeys, statements/break, Function.prototype,
  language/types/string. Highlights below.

- **Top-level `await` in modules — full bucket green** (250 → 251
  on `language/module-code/top-level-await`). Three-stage roll-
  out: always-defer `await` (§27.7.5.3 PromiseResolve+then),
  async-module drain-to-settlement on static import, owning-
  module thread-through on resume so `module_export` after a
  TLA-await lands in the right namespace. Final finisher added
  the `module_link_complete` opcode (drains microtasks after the
  importer's hoisted import block so sync siblings get to run
  while an async dep is mid-`await`; CycleRoot-via-cycle-leaf
  ordering falls out without modelling [[CycleRoot]] directly).
  Drive-by: `loadModule` now properly save/restores
  `current_module` (was clobbering to `null` on return);
  `publishExportedNamesFromDecl` walks BindingPattern leaves so
  `export const { x } = obj` publishes `x`.

- **Proxy traps — full §9.5 invariant enforcement on proxy-of-
  proxy** (built-ins/Proxy: 81.67 → 90.68 % attempted). All
  five mutating traps (`get`, `set`, `has`, `deleteProperty`,
  `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`) recurse through chained Proxy
  ancestors; `Object.{keys, getOwnPropertyNames}` +
  `Reflect.ownKeys` route through the trap; strict-mode
  `delete` throws TypeError on trap-returned-false (§13.5.1.2
  step 6); `defineProperty`-trap-falsy → Reflect-false fall-
  through.

- **`super.method(...rest)` compile** (§13.3.7.1) — added
  `compileSuperSpreadMethodCall` as the apply-style parallel
  of `compileSpreadMethodCall`. Lands the seven Set
  `subclass-receiver-methods.js` fixtures plus collaterals.

- **§7.3.21 EnumerableOwnProperties for Object.{values,
  entries}** — Symbol + Proxy trap dispatch + per-key
  descriptor accessor walk.

- **§24 collection ctors — spec-faithful Map / WeakMap / Set
  / WeakSet** (Map 91 → 99 %, WeakMap 100 %, WeakSet 100 %,
  Set 91 → 97 %). `Get(set, "add")` consulted only when
  iterable provided; AddValuesFromIterable invokes user-
  installed `add`; IteratorClose on all abrupt paths.
  Symbols-as-WeakSet/Map-keys (CanBeHeldWeakly) shipped.

- **Genuinely weak `WeakRef` / `WeakMap` / `WeakSet` /
  `FinalizationRegistry`.** The major collector
  (`Heap.collectFull`) treats the weak slots as weak edges: a
  §24.3 WeakMap ephemeron fixpoint (a value is live iff its key
  is) plus a post-mark pass clears dead `WeakRef` targets,
  tombstones dead WeakMap/WeakSet entries, and queues
  `FinalizationRegistry` cleanup jobs onto the microtask drain.
  `collectYoung` keeps strong-marking — a young weak target
  tenures and is handled at the next major cycle (GC timing is
  spec-unspecified, so this is conformant). See
  [docs/handbook/gc.md](handbook/gc.md).

- **Math.sumPrecise (§21.3.2.21) + JSON.rawJSON + JSON.isRawJSON
  (§25.5.{3,4})** — two ES2025 Stage-4 built-ins shipped
  (Shewchuk exact-floating-point summation with overflow-
  recovery, raw-JSON brand bit + stringify fast-path).

- **§13.4 UpdateExpression BigInt-correct postfix / prefix**
  — new zero-operand `inc` / `dec` opcodes dispatching on
  numeric type. `0n++` no longer mixes BigInt + Number;
  `obj[k]++` evaluates `ToPropertyKey(k)` once across
  GetValue + PutValue.

- **§12.8.6 Tagged-template freezing + receiver binding** —
  template + raw arrays carry the §13.2.8.4 frozen
  descriptors (indexed slots `{w:F,e:T,c:F}`, length / raw
  `{w:F,e:F,c:F}`, extensible:false). Member-form tag
  binds `this` to the receiver via `call_method`. Quasi
  cooking handles `\xNN` / `\uNNNN` / `\u{N}` /
  line-continuation per spec.
- **§15.7.14 step 11 lexical private-name resolution across
  nested classes** — `#x` mangles with the *declaring* class's
  prefix, not the innermost. `ClassContext.private_names` +
  `manglePrivateRef` walk `class_stack` outward; the runtime
  carries `private_compile_prefix` alongside `private_brand` so
  `framePrivateBrand` picks the right per-evaluation brand by
  matching the key's `P{n}#` prefix against the prototype chain.
  `language/statements/class/elements` 54 → 42 fail (−12).
- **§13.2.5 ComputedPropertyName for class keys evaluates
  inline.** Sub-chunk dispatch (call-out to a synthesised
  function frame at class-definition time) is gone — keys
  evaluate in the enclosing generator frame so `yield` /
  `await` inside `[expr]` works. Eight `cpn-class-*-from-yield/
  await-expression` fixtures land.
- **module-code bucket: +32 pass** — `arbitrary-module-
  namespace-names` (StringLiteral as ModuleExportName, `export
  * as "ns"`), module namespace `IsExtensible` /
  `SetPrototypeOf` honor the §9.4.6 brand, `@@toStringTag`
  installs at brand-on-allocation time (not at finalisation —
  visible during cycles), hoisted `export default function`
  (anonymous + named), module-top `class C {}` as a let
  binding, `export var` published at module-instantiation
  hoist, cross-function `const` write defers to runtime
  (§9.1.1.1.4). Net: 87 → 92 % spec on `language/module-
  code`.

- **Spec-faithful `yield*` delegation** for both sync and
  async generators (§15.5.5 / §27.6.3.7). Three-step plan
  shipped: `Generator.prototype.throw` injects at the
  suspended yield site via a new `pending_throw` slot;
  sync forwarding wires `next` / `return` / `throw`
  through the inner iterator with IteratorClose-on-
  absent-throw (§14.4.14 step 7.iii.2); async mirrors
  with `await`-driven inner-call ticks.
  `built-ins/AsyncFromSyncIteratorPrototype` went 21 % →
  76 % spec; `built-ins/AsyncGeneratorPrototype` 67 % →
  77 %.
- **GlobalEnvironmentRecord split** (§9.1.1.4) — `let`
  / `const` / `class` at top level live in a declarative
  env-record alongside the object record (`var` /
  `function`), with `[[VarNames]]` tracked separately.
  `sta_global_init` / `sta_global_fn_decl` / `sta_global`
  opcodes dispatch through the split.
  `language/global-code` now at 100 %. See
  [handbook/environments.md](handbook/environments.md).
- **§16.1.7 GlobalDeclarationInstantiation early-error
  pass** — `lex`-vs-`lex` / `lex`-vs-`var` collision,
  `HasRestrictedGlobalProperty` (`NaN` / `Infinity` /
  `undefined`), `CanDeclareGlobalVar` /
  `CanDeclareGlobalFunction` on a non-extensible global.
- **Named function expression self-binding** (§15.6.5) —
  synthetic 1-binding wrapper env holds `G` as immutable
  inside the body; writes throw TypeError at runtime via
  `throw_assign_const`.
- **Module Namespace [[Get]] honors TDZ** — uninit lex
  binding access through a namespace surfaces as
  ReferenceError per §9.4.6.7 + §8.1.1.1.6.
  `[[HasProperty]]` / `[[OwnPropertyKeys]]` stay non-
  throwing.
- **Indirect import bindings + TDZ-Hole seeding on
  exports** — importer sees ReferenceError before source
  module evaluates (§8.1.1.5.5 + §15.2.1.16.4 step 12);
  writes throw TypeError. `re-export-from` (`export { X }
  from './x.js'`) flows through the same indirect path.
- **Spec-faithful Symbol.{split, match, matchAll, replace,
  search}** rewrites (§22.2.5.{8,9,11,13,15}) routing
  through `SpeciesConstructor`, `regExpExecGeneric`,
  `setPropertyChainOrThrow`, `advanceStringIndex` with
  full abrupt-completion propagation. RegExp `/d` flag +
  MakeIndicesArray (§22.2.7.{2,7}) shipped.
- **Date rewrite**: coercion order (§21.4.2 step 3
  in-order ToNumber per argument), `parse` boundary clamp
  (±8.64e15 ms), `toJSON`, `@@toPrimitive`, formatting,
  prop descriptors. Whole `built-ins/Date` bucket at
  100 %.
- **JSON.parse + JSON.stringify abrupt-completion
  propagation** (§25.5.1.1, §25.5.2) — proxy-aware
  Get / Delete / OwnKeys / CreateDataProperty, BigInt
  TypeError per spec, revoked-proxy-as-value TypeError.
- **Lexer `\u{XX}` identifier escape canonicalization**
  (§12.7) — `var \u{61} = 1; a === 1`. The
  `decodeIdentifierName` helper now feeds every binding-
  name resolve / declare / assign site, not just
  property-key.
- **Bulk SES skiplist** — 218 Sputnik + cross-realm
  fixtures using `Function(string)` / `eval(string)` /
  `new other.Function` exhaustively identified and moved
  to `skip_ses_exact_paths` (permanent OOS per AGENTS.md
  SES carve-out). Total count down from 40 700 to 40 411.
- **`tools/test262.zig` `loader_state` made `threadlocal`**
  — was a process-global racing across workers, surfacing
  as ~9 flaky `language/module-code` + ~20 flaky
  `language/expressions/dynamic-import` fixtures whose
  pass/fail flipped between runs. With the fix parallel
  and `--threads=1` agree exactly. See
  [handbook/agent-checks.md](handbook/agent-checks.md).
- Generator `.return()` drives pending `try { yield } finally`
  blocks via `unwindThrow` + an `is_finally` Handler flag and
  the `realm.gen_return_completion` sentinel that skips user
  `catch` clauses (§27.5.1.3).
- Async arrow IIFE now wraps the body value in a Promise
  (§15.8) — `(async () => 1)()` returns a Promise instead of
  the body's value. One-line compiler fix.
- `globalThis` is a live view over `realm.globals` (no
  snapshot) — late-installed host bindings (`$DONE`, `$262`,
  etc.) reflect through automatically. Replaces the
  `intrinsics.install`-time snapshot pattern.
- Labeled `break` / `continue` threaded through
  `LoopContext.labels` (§14.13 / §14.16 / §14.17).
- Computed-key object destructuring in both declaration and
  assignment patterns (§14.3.3 / §13.15.5).
- Class inner `C` lexical binding (§15.7.1 step 8): visible to
  method bodies, distinct from any outer scope's `C`.
- Three closed root gaps from the previous handbook list
  (frame stacks, promise reactions, key anchors) — the
  remaining residuals at `gc_threshold=1` would be new natives
  missing a `HandleScope`, not the previously-tracked four.

## Standard library

**Done (with caveats noted).**

- `Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `BigInt`,
  `Symbol` constructors + prototypes covering the bulk of static
  and instance methods.
- `Function.prototype.{call, apply, bind}` + bound-function
  trampoline.
- `Math` (including the ES2022 additions); `JSON.stringify` +
  `JSON.parse`; URI handling globals (`encodeURI` /
  `encodeURIComponent` / `decodeURI` / `decodeURIComponent` with
  full UTF-8 validation throwing `URIError` on malformed input).
- `Date` with full getter / setter surface (UTC-only — see
  caveats).
- `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet` with `groupBy` statics.
  `Set.prototype` covers the ES2025 family
  (`union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetricDifference`,
  `isSubsetOf`, `isSupersetOf`, `isDisjointFrom`).
- `Promise` static methods (`all`, `allSettled`, `any`, `race`,
  `resolve`, `reject`, `try`, `withResolvers`) + prototype `then`
  / `catch` / `finally`. Aggregators go through §27.2.1.5
  NewPromiseCapability and forward each item via
  `Invoke(item, "then", « cap.resolve, cap.reject »)`, so
  microtask ordering matches the spec.
- `Reflect` covering `apply`, `construct`, `defineProperty`,
  `deleteProperty`, `get`, `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`,
  `getPrototypeOf`, `has`, `isExtensible`, `ownKeys`,
  `preventExtensions`, `set`, `setPrototypeOf`.
- `Proxy` with `get`, `set`, `has`, `deleteProperty`,
  `defineProperty`, `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, `ownKeys` traps;
  callable proxies (function-target forwarding).
- `RegExp` backed by **Perlex**, Cynic's own regex engine (full
  ECMA-262 conformance — flags, captures, lookaround, named
  groups, `u` / `v` flags). String methods (`match`, `matchAll`,
  `replace`, `replaceAll`, `search`, `split`) all dispatch
  through it.
- `Iterator` global with `from` + prototype helpers (`map`,
  `filter`, `take`, `drop`, `flatMap`, `toArray`, `forEach`,
  `find`, `some`, `every`, `reduce`).
- TypedArrays + DataView covering the common surface. ES2024
  `Float16Array` + `DataView.{get,set}Float16` are wired
  (IEEE 754 binary16). ES2024 resizable ArrayBuffer (resize +
  maxByteLength), `IsFixedLengthArrayBuffer` propagation, and
  length-tracking views (`new TA(rab)` with omitted length) are
  shipped — view byteOffset / length / byteLength getters and
  every prototype iteration method re-resolve length per access.
  `%TypedArray%.from` + `%TypedArray%.of` ship as static methods
  on the abstract intrinsic and are inherited by every concrete
  ctor via the static_parent chain. `%TypedArray%[@@species]`
  accessor installed with accessor-aware lookup for subclass
  species ctor dispatch. Detached-buffer state on `ArrayBuffer`
  + `ValidateTypedArray` propagates to every TA/DataView
  operation per §25.1.3 / §10.4.5.x.
- `Array.fromAsync` (§23.1.2.1.1) — drives sync iterables,
  `@@asyncIterator`, and array-like fallback through a
  capability + bound `.then` chain (spec-conformant deferral via
  the microtask queue). Honors `this`-constructor for subclass
  calls and writes each element via CreateDataPropertyOrThrow.
- Error class hierarchy: `Error`, `TypeError`, `RangeError`,
  `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, `URIError`, `EvalError`,
  `AggregateError`.

**Pre-Stage-4 proposals shipped (opt-in).** Cynic deliberately
ships a handful of TC39 proposals before they reach Stage 4 / a
published edition, where the spec text is stable enough and the
feature unlocks useful programs. Each is gated behind a per-realm
feature flag — `Realm.feature_flags`, defined in
`src/runtime/features.zig`. The `cynic` CLI defaults to all-off
(embedder-friendly default) and exposes flags to opt in:

- `--enable=<name>` — enable one feature.
- `--enable-experimental` — enable the whole tracked set.
- `--list-features` — print the available set with descriptions.

Each shipped proposal carries a `PRE-STAGE-4 PROPOSAL` comment at
the installer site so a future spec shift surfaces the right
place to revisit. The current set:

- **`ShadowRealm`** (Stage 2.7) — the `ShadowRealm` constructor
  plus the §3.8 cross-realm callable boundary (`.evaluate` /
  `.importValue`). Installer in
  `src/runtime/builtins/shadow_realm.zig`, gated in
  `intrinsics.install`. See [docs/multi-realm.md](multi-realm.md)
  for the per-realm substrate and teardown story. Off by default
  in the CLI and excluded from headline conformance.

(`joint-iteration` — `Iterator.zip` / `Iterator.zipKeyed` —
graduated out of this list on 2026-07-08 when the proposal
advanced to Stage 4 (May 2026, ES2027 bucket); the methods
install unconditionally now, same move as `upsert` in 2026-05.)

Revisit this list each TC39 meeting cycle. If a proposal stalls,
demotes, or its semantics flip, follow the comment trail in the
installer and either back the change out or update.

The conformance harness scores each tracked feature as its own
**dedicated phase sweep** — each proposal's fixtures run in a
realm with only that one flag enabled, so each row reflects the
proposal in honest isolation.
A `zig build test262 -- --write-results` invocation runs the
main ECMA-262 sweep (pre-Stage-4 fixtures excluded entirely
from `total` / cache / per-area buckets) followed by one
dedicated sweep per feature; the per-feature numbers source the
`## Pre-Stage-4 proposals shipped` table in
`test262-results.md`. Iterate on one feature in isolation with
`--phase=feature:<name>`. Adding a new pre-Stage-4 proposal:
extend `FeatureFlag` in `src/runtime/features.zig`, gate the
installer site, and the harness picks up the new column
automatically on the next full sweep.

**Caveats / planned.**

- `Date` is UTC-only — `getTimezoneOffset` always returns 0,
  every `getXxx` method behaves like its `getUTCXxx` peer, and
  `toString` / `toLocaleString` render
  `... GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)`. Spec-conformant
  per §21.4 (the implementation picks the local time zone;
  `"UTC"` is a permitted choice) — every `built-ins/Date`
  fixture passes. Practical for edge / server JS where the host
  owns scheduling; not a polished story for a UI that needs to
  render local time. Real timezone handling would need a
  vendored tz-data source (IANA `tzdata`) plus the per-method
  local-time conversions; deferred until a user actually asks.
- `Intl` is a **build flavour**, not a CLI `--enable=` / `--allow=`
  verb (those remain pre-Stage-4 proposals and security relaxations
  respectively; see [ses-alignment.md](ses-alignment.md)). Compile
  with `zig build -Dintl=off|stub|full` (default **`off`**):

  | Tier | `Intl` global | Temporal calendars / IANA | Locale/tz data |
  |------|---------------|---------------------------|----------------|
  | **`off`** (default) | absent | ISO + UTC/fixed-offset only | none |
  | **`stub`** | structural ECMA-402 (option validation; format/compare stubs) | accept supported calendar **ids** and structural IANA **names**; arithmetic still ISO/UTC | none |
  | **`full`** | `stub` surface, plus CLDR-backed `Intl.PluralRules`, `Intl.NumberFormat` (decimal + percent + currency), `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (gregorian), and `Intl.DisplayNames` | real zone offsets via embedded CYTZ/TZif (`vendor/tzdata/cynic_tzdb.bin`); IANA sources in `vendor/tzdata/iana/` (fetch: `tools/fetch-tzdata.sh`; pack: `zig build pack-tzdata`) | tzdb + CLDR (`vendor/cldr/cynic_cldr.bin`, ~3 MiB) |

  The default edge/server build omits the locale/tz stack to stay
  small and dependency-light. `intl402/` stays out of the main
  ECMA-262 scoreboard (`spec%`); exercise it explicitly under
  `-Dintl=stub` or `-Dintl=full` (e.g. `zig build test262 -Dintl=stub
  -- --filter=intl402/`). Cynic's `localeCompare` returns a
  canonical-equivalence-aware compare via NFD-then-ordinal (note
  in §22.1.3.12); case-sensitive Turkish-style collation is
  what's missing without real Intl data, not basic NFC folding.

  **CLDR data** is vendored the way tzdata is: JSON sources are fetched
  into `vendor/cldr/json/` (gitignored — tens of MB) via
  `tools/fetch-cldr.sh` (the [cldr-json](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json)
  npm packages, modern coverage tier), and `zig build pack-cldr` packs the
  committed `vendor/cldr/cynic_cldr.bin` (CYCL container) consulted only at
  `-Dintl=full`. **`Intl.PluralRules`** consumes the plural section: the UTS #35
  Part 3 rule engine (`src/runtime/cldr.zig`) computes plural operands over
  `FormatNumericToString` and evaluates the locale's cardinal/ordinal rules.
  **`Intl.NumberFormat`** consumes the numbers + numbering-systems sections —
  decimal, percent, currency, and unit styles plus scientific / engineering /
  compact notation, with locale symbols, primary/secondary grouping,
  numbering-system digit substitution (e.g. arab ٠١٢٣), sign display, the
  rounding modes (roundingPriority / roundingIncrement), fraction/significant-
  digit rounding (via the engine's exact `dtoa`), and `formatRange` /
  `formatRangeToParts`. **`Intl.DateTimeFormat`** consumes the dates section
  (gregorian): dateStyle/timeStyle and the component options (weekday/era/year/
  month/day/hour/minute/second/fractionalSecondDigits/dayPeriod) resolve to a
  CLDR pattern, interpreted against the broken-down time in the format's time
  zone with localized names, hourCycle, and digit substitution, plus
  `formatRange` / `formatRangeToParts` and timeZone validation.
  **`Intl.DurationFormat`** ships `format` / `formatToParts` over the per-unit
  style options. **`Intl.DisplayNames`** consumes the display-names section —
  `of(code)` resolves language / region / script / currency codes to their
  localized names (with per-type canonicalisation + RangeError on malformed
  codes); these tables dominate the blob (~2.8 MiB at `full`). DateTimeFormat
  skeleton best-fit + non-gregorian calendars, and DisplayNames
  calendar/dateTimeField types stay structural until their CLDR sections are
  packed; timeZoneName renders CLDR metazone names (long / short, standard vs
  daylight via a DST-from-offset probe), falling back to the localized GMT
  offset for a zone with no metazone name at the requested width.

  Seams are kept clean so `full` can deepen without a rewrite —
  Temporal funnels every zone-offset lookup through
  `getOffsetNanosecondsFor` (see "Temporal" below), and
  `localeCompare` isolates its NFD pipeline.

**Shipped.** `Temporal` (ES2025) — the full value-type surface
plus `Temporal.Now`. All eight types land: `Instant`, `PlainTime`,
`PlainDate`, `PlainDateTime`, `PlainYearMonth`, `PlainMonthDay`,
`Duration`, and `ZonedDateTime`, each with its constructor,
getters, `from` / `compare`, `with*`, the arithmetic chain
(`add` / `subtract` / `until` / `since`), `round` / `total`, the
`toString` / `toJSON` / `toLocaleString` family with precision +
rounding options, and ISO-8601 string parsing — plus
`Date.prototype.toTemporalInstant`. The arithmetic and rounding
abstract operations (RoundNumberToIncrement, the duration
balance / round / difference chain, NudgeToCalendarUnit /
BubbleRelativeDuration, RoundRelativeDuration) are named to match
proposal-temporal so test262 failures map to spec steps.
`built-ins/Temporal` scores 3885 pass / 0 fail across the corpus,
and the headline runtime spec% moved to ~94.56% when the tree came
out of the skip list.

With **`-Dintl=off`** (default), the scope is **ISO-8601 calendar +
UTC/fixed-offset zones only** — named zones and non-ISO calendars
are rejected. With **`-Dintl=stub`**, those are accepted
structurally (ids/names stored; math still ISO/UTC). Real DST
offsets and non-ISO calendar arithmetic remain the payoff of
**`-Dintl=full`** plus tzdata (and later calendar/CLDR data). Every
offset lookup already routes through one `getOffsetNanosecondsFor`
seam so tzdata plugs in at a single place rather than threading
through each `ZonedDateTime` operation.

**Non-ISO calendar status (`-Dintl=full`).** The gregorian-month and
computational calendars are implemented end-to-end — getters, `from` / `with`,
`add` / `subtract` / `until` / `since`, `PlainMonthDay` (with the
`CalendarMonthDayToISOReferenceDate` reference year), eras, and DateTimeFormat
numeric rendering — across `PlainDate` / `PlainDateTime` / `PlainYearMonth` /
`ZonedDateTime`:

- **gregorian-month**: gregory, roc, buddhist, and japanese (the imperial era
  table — meiji / taisho / showa / heisei / reiwa with the date-based
  boundaries, pre-Meiji falling back to proleptic ce/bce);
- **computational**: islamic-civil + islamic-tbla (tabular; `islamic` /
  `islamic-rgsa` fold to islamic-civil), coptic, ethiopic and ethioaa, indian
  (Saka), and persian (Solar Hijri, the 33-year arithmetic leap cycle).

Dual eras are modelled where the calendar needs them (islamic ah↔bh, ethiopic
am↔aa); era + eraYear are accepted as input fields and cross-checked against
`year`. The `since` / `until` difference handles the intercalary-month /
end-of-month-wrap edge cases by comparing the raw (unclamped) day, matching the
ISO `CalendarDateUntil`.

Still outstanding, and the reason the headline is not yet ~100% of intl402:

- **lunisolar calendars** — hebrew (the arithmetic molad + dehiyyot core is
  solved and verified, but landing it needs year-dependent month counts in the
  difference engine, leap-month codes — Adar I = `M05L` — across the from / with
  / PlainMonthDay paths, and CLDR hebrew month *names* for DateTimeFormat);
  chinese and dangi (astronomical new-moon / solar-term data). Implementing one
  lunisolar calendar in isolation regresses the cross-engine DateTimeFormat
  comparison fixtures, which require the whole lunisolar set rendered
  consistently — so they land together, not piecemeal.
- **islamic-umalqura** — the Umm-al-Qura month-length data table.
- **non-Temporal ECMA-402 tails** — DateTimeFormat skeleton best-fit,
  NumberFormat unit / compact, Collator (DUCET), Segmenter (UAX #29), and the
  remaining locale-tag canonicalization aliases (variant / subdivision / `-t-`
  transformed-extension ordering).

**Out of scope.** Annex B in its entirety — language extensions
*and* every browser-era built-in (`escape` / `unescape`, the
String HTML wrappers, `Date.prototype.{getYear, setYear,
toGMTString}`, `String.prototype.{substr, trimLeft, trimRight}`,
`Object.prototype.__proto__` accessor and the `__define*` /
`__lookup*` family, `RegExp.{$1, input, …}` legacy globals).
`Intl` in the default (`-Dintl=off`) build — see the `-Dintl=`
build-flavour table above.

`SharedArrayBuffer` / `Atomics` **ship**, with real cross-agent
concurrency: `$262.agent` runs each agent on its own OS thread and
realm, sharing a refcounted backing block, and `Atomics.wait` /
`notify` coordinate across threads. `SharedArrayBuffer` is an
`ArrayBuffer` minus detach plus `grow`; the read-modify-write / load /
store / `compareExchange` / `isLockFree` operations are sequential ops
on the shared store. Full design + the phased landing in
[sab-atomics.md](sab-atomics.md) and
[multi-agent-atomics.md](multi-agent-atomics.md). (Ongoing refinement —
e.g. an exact-count FIFO wait list — continues in the multi-agent
effort.)

## Modules

**Done.**

- ES6 module syntax (`import` / `export` / namespace re-exports)
  parses + compiles. Single-file evaluation works.
- `Realm.evaluateScript` host hook (powers multi-file
  `cynic run` and the test262 harness loader). Not exposed to
  user JS.
- `import.meta` (returns a fresh empty object — no metadata yet).
- Dynamic `import()` against the host module loader — fulfilled
  with the namespace on success, rejected with the loader's
  `TypeError` on failure (§13.3.10).

**Done (additions).**

- Indirect import bindings as live aliases per §8.1.1.5.5
  CreateImportBinding, with TDZ-Hole-seeding on the source
  module's exports so the importer sees ReferenceError until
  the source body initialises (§15.2.1.16.4 step 12). Writes
  to an import throw TypeError.
- Module Namespace exotic [[Get]] honors TDZ — uninit lex
  binding surfaces ReferenceError per §9.4.6.7 + §8.1.1.1.6.
  `[[HasProperty]]` / `[[OwnPropertyKeys]]` stay non-throwing.
- Re-exports (`export { X } from './x.js'`) and star
  re-exports (`export * from`) route through indirect bindings.
- Top-level `await` in module bodies — full bucket green.
  Async module bodies run via `startAsyncCall`; the
  `module_link_complete` opcode drains microtasks after the
  hoisted import block; `loadModule` records suspended async
  deps on `ModuleRecord.pending_async_deps` and propagates
  rejection at the link boundary (§16.2.1.5 / §16.2.1.9
  parent-path, approximated). Dynamic `import()` chains its
  Promise to the dep's evaluation Promise so the import()
  result reflects the post-TLA namespace.
- StringLiteral as ModuleExportName (§16.2.3.5) — `export {
  X as "Y" }`, `export * as "ns" from "src"`, `import {
  "Y" as local }`. Quotes stripped at compile time; the
  raw key indexes the namespace.
- §9.4.6.{1,3} namespace `IsExtensible` / `SetPrototypeOf`
  are brand-aware — a Module Namespace exotic refuses
  extension and prototype change with the spec-mandated
  `false` return, not the OrdinaryObject default.
- `@@toStringTag` installs at brand-on-allocation time so
  cycles see `Object.prototype.toString.call(ns)` returning
  `"[object Module]"` while the namespace is still
  `extensible`.

**Planned.**

- Module-evaluation cycle resolution edge cases — the residual
  failures are in the `language/module-code/instn-{iee,star}-*`
  + `ambiguous-export-bindings/*` clusters and need the full
  §15.2.1.16.3 ResolveExport chain (indirect-export forward,
  ambiguity detection) + `export * from` namespace merge.
- Full §16.2.1.5 [[PendingAsyncDependencies]] +
  [[AsyncEvaluationOrder]] graph — Cynic's `pending_async_
  deps` slot is a lightweight stand-in; the remaining
  fixtures that exercise sort ordering need the real machinery.

## Regex

**Done.** Vendored QuickJS-NG `libregexp.c` (MIT, ~2600 LOC C)
provided the initial full ECMA-262 surface, bridged from Zig with
UTF-8 ↔ UTF-16 transcoding so match indices land in spec-correct
UTF-16 code units. The native backtracking engine — **Perlex**
(`src/perlex/`) — now sits first in dispatch and owns **every pattern
the test262 corpus exercises**: backreferences, named groups (incl.
duplicate-name early errors), lookahead / lookbehind (with captures,
backreferences, nested assertions), the whole `/v` UnicodeSets grammar
(set algebra, nested classes, `\q{…}` string disjunctions, `\p{…}`
properties of strings), `/iu` / `/iv` and non-`/u` `i` case folding
(§22.2.2.9 Canonicalize), the ES2024 inline-modifier groups
(`(?ims-ims:…)`), quantifiers over nullable bodies and over huge /
unbounded counts, and the §22.2.1.1 strict-grammar early errors (the
Annex B carve-outs below). No real engine failures remain in the
RegExp corpus.

**libregexp is gone.** The vendored matcher (`libregexp.c`), its
runtime bridge, the parse-time validator fallback, and the build
wiring have all been removed — Perlex is the sole regex engine. The
removal was gated on a fall-through census of **0** (no corpus pattern
ever reached the fallback, on either the runtime or the parse path)
and a head-to-head benchmark (Perlex is 1.9–3.5× faster, see above).
A pattern Perlex can't compile now throws `SyntaxError` with no
fallback; the only `error.Unsupported` residuals are census-invisible
(malformed UTF-8, the pathological `(a?){10^23}` bounded by the VM
step limit). `libunicode.c` is gone too — String case conversion
(`src/unicode/case_conv.zig`), normalization
(`src/unicode/normalization.zig`, NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD per §3.11 / UAX#15),
and Perlex case folding all run on native tables now. With both
matchers retired, the entire `vendor/quickjs/` directory was deleted
(`libregexp.c`, `libunicode.c`, `cutils.c`) — Cynic vendors no C.
The WASM glue went with it: `src/wasm_shim.c` and `src/runtime/c_alloc.zig`
are gone, so the WASM build has no C either (optional `wasm-opt -Oz`
minification step).

**Replacement-gate benchmark — Perlex vs libregexp.** The final
pre-removal snapshot (the `bench-regex` harness that produced it was
retired alongside libregexp — there is no second engine to compare
against now). In-process, ReleaseFast, identical `(pattern, UTF-16
input)` pairs; Perlex was faster on every case and returned the same
match on all of them (`agree: yes`). Run 2026-06-01, cynic `5090791`:

| Geomean (Perlex-owned cases) | Perlex speedup |
|---|--:|
| compile (all) | 1.90× |
| exec (common patterns) | 2.98× |
| exec (worst-case) | 3.49× |

Per-case medians (ns/iter; `comp×` / `exec×` = libregexp ÷ Perlex,
>1 → Perlex faster):

Memory (RegExp bucket, `--mem-summary`, engine-side counters — also the
post-removal runtime numbers): 42 MiB max
per-fixture engine peak, 5.6 MiB avg, 27 GC cycles / 25 ms total pause,
0 fail. The heaviest process-RSS fixtures (199 MB on `\S`-over-all-
Unicode, ~100 MB on the `CharacterClassEscapes` positive-cases) are
inherent whole-Unicode set-construction tests, engine-agnostic. The
regex removal dropped `libregexp.c` (2610 lines C) from the build, and
the subsequent native-Unicode work dropped `libunicode.c` (1746 lines)
and the rest of `vendor/quickjs/` with it. The ES2024 `regexp-modifiers`
feature ships via Perlex, so no regex *feature* is unshipped; remaining
polish is `RegExp.prototype` property edge cases (`lastIndex`, `flags`,
`dotAll`) and minor String.prototype dispatch corners.

**Annex B regex grammar (§B.1.4) — narrowed by Perlex.**
The §22.2.1 main grammar makes `]`, `{`, `}` SyntaxCharacters
with no literal reading, treats a DecimalEscape `\N` past the
capture count as an early error (§22.2.1.1), requires a
DecimalDigits lower bound on every Quantifier brace, and makes a
`-` class range with a CharacterClassEscape bound (`[\d-a]` /
`[a-\d]`) a §22.2.1.1 early error. Annex B §B.1.2 relaxes all of
these when a pattern is compiled *without* the `u` / `v` flag — a
stray brace/bracket becomes a literal ExtendedPatternCharacter,
`\N` rereads as a legacy octal/identity escape (e.g. `\1` outside
a group → `\001`), `{,n}` reads as literal text, and the `-` in
`[\d-a]` rereads as a literal (`\d`, `-`, `a`).

Cynic drops every one of these in every mode. **Perlex** — the
native regex engine and now the sole one — raises `SyntaxError` for
all of them, so every pattern is held to the strict main grammar
(`u` / `v` already rejected them; non-Unicode mode does too) with no
fallback to leak the Annex B leniency (the vendored libregexp matcher
that once did has been removed). Every shipping browser engine (V8 /
JSC / SpiderMonkey) accepts the Annex B forms; Cynic's non-browser
target is why it doesn't. Everywhere else the "no Annex B" stance
from AGENTS.md is enforced (language extensions, browser-era
built-ins, accessor / legacy-global aliases), and the
`annexB/built-ins/RegExp/` corpus stays path-skipped.

## Tooling

**Done.**

- `cynic parse <file>` / `cynic eval '<expr>'` / `cynic run <file>` /
  `cynic repl` (persistent realm, microtask drain between lines,
  `.exit` / `.quit` / Ctrl-D, `Name: message` error rendering).
- `cynic run --dump-bytecode` disassembles compiled chunks
  (script + every nested function template) and exits without
  executing — useful for tracing codegen shape and verifying
  peephole / IC work.
- Opt-in bytecode telemetry: build with `-Dbytecode-stats=true`,
  then run `cynic run --bytecode-stats <file>`. Reports static
  nested-chunk bytes / operand-width fit plus dynamic opcode,
  pair, and trigram frequencies; normal builds compile the
  counters out.
- `zig build test262 -- ...` parser and runtime modes; harness
  loads `harness/sta.js` + `assert.js` automatically; per-file
  outcome on `--verbose`; failure list on `--list-failures=N`;
  results history in [test262-results.md](../test262-results.md).
- Score history written by `--write-results`. Fast iteration via
  `--only-failing` (skip-as-pass any path in
  `.test262-pass-cache.txt`, ~5× faster than a full sweep).
- Memory / leak instrumentation: `--gc-stats` (per-cycle pool
  counts + bytes), `--mem-summary` (end-of-sweep totals),
  `--top-rss=N` (heaviest fixtures by process RSS delta),
  `--top-alloc=N` (heaviest by cumulative bytes allocated —
  catches GC-cleaned thrash that RSS hides),
  `--leak-check` (route the per-fixture bytes allocator through
  `std.heap.DebugAllocator`; stack trace per unfreed allocation
  at exit), `--max-rss=<mb>` (abort with the offending fixture
  path when RSS crosses budget).
- CI: `zig build`, `zig build test-fast`, and the
  `test262-jit-differential` pass-set comparison gating; the full
  test262 sweep advisory + a `test262-rss-smoke` advisory job
  that prints per-fixture RSS deltas via `--top-rss`.

**Planned.**

- Source-map–style position info in stack traces.

## Performance

Cynic targets edge runtimes — fast cold-start, small RSS,
predictable latency. Correctness still leads, but the perf work
has started: the dispatch loop, the GC, and string concatenation
have all had a pass (see **Shipped** below). Cross-engine
measurement infrastructure lives at
[docs/benchmarking.md](benchmarking.md); per-commit micro-bench
deltas are produced by the `/perf` slash command and hot-function
sampling by `/profile`.

**Shipped.**

- **Threaded interpreter dispatch (rung-3 / 4 / 5).** The
  `while + switch` dispatch loop became a Zig labeled switch with
  per-opcode `continue :dispatch` tails (rung-3); opcode decode
  dropped a per-step `std.enums.fromInt` enum scan for a raw
  `@enumFromInt` cast (rung-4); arithmetic / comparison / bitwise
  opcodes gained int32 fast paths (rung-5). Combined, `arith_loop`
  fell ~20× — see `bench-results.md`.
- **Schema-driven compact bytecode (2026-07-15).** `Op.spec()` is
  now the one source for mnemonics, operands, control-flow class,
  and Bistromath support. Finalization selects narrow immediates /
  IC operands, relaxes every relative branch to i8/i16/i32, remaps
  source / handler / switch side tables, and emits a dense-int32
  `switch_smi` table when §14.12 ordering permits. Load, store, and
  computed-property ICs use typed arrays instead of one 96-byte
  union-like cell. CFG/liveness models N-way switch edges and
  implicit register windows; dead stores and redundant adjacent
  `Star r; Ldar r` reloads are removed only after the finalized CFG
  proves the load has no other predecessor. On the
  instrumented non-JIT Richards run this pass moved static
  instructions **1,509 → 1,456** (-3.5%), encoded bytes **3,122 →
  3,067** (-1.8%), and dynamic dispatches **107,516,101 →
  104,678,462** (-2.64%).
- **Bistromath continuation + hardened-load closure (2026-07-16).**
  Catch/finally PCs now receive compiled reentry stubs in the shared
  bytecode-continuation table; the driver invokes Lantern's real unwinder
  once, then continues in compiled code when the selected handler belongs to
  its frame subtree. The typed load IC also gained a GC-safe
  `synthetic_accessor` mode for the immutable internal getters installed by
  the SES override-mistake fix. A controlled 5M-call ReleaseFast A/B measured
  the hardened `hasOwnProperty` path **304.6 → 152.8 ms p50 (-49.8%)**.
  Full main test262 reference and `--jit` sweeps match at
  **48,653 / 49,977 (97.35%)**; the SES suite remains **36 / 36**.
- **Ohaimark optimizer front end (2026-07-16).** The T2 ADR is now
  concrete: typed ICs snapshot into immutable same-index arrays without
  copying GC-managed callee/prototype/snapshot pointers; finalized bytecode
  lowers into a flat CFG SSA graph whose block arguments pre-create
  accumulator and live-register phis, including loop back-edges. Liveness
  now exposes exceptional edges explicitly, while handler-bearing and
  unsupported chunks reject cleanly to the lower tiers. Optimizing codegen is
  still off; verified deopt metadata comes first.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark specialization planner (2026-07-16).** Generic named-property
  loads now enter SSA beside arithmetic and control flow. A pure fixed-point
  pass propagates a compact value lattice through block arguments, folds only
  semantics-safe int32 operations (overflow and negative-zero products stay
  guarded), and selects checked arithmetic or feedback-driven named-load
  lowerings. Every removable property assumption stores only the live typed-IC
  index, realm-arena-stable shapes, and scalar guards; no GC-managed prototype
  or accessor value enters optimizer state. Cold or invalidated sites remain
  generic, and malformed feedback indices reject compilation.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark logical deopt metadata (2026-07-16).** Potentially speculative
  arithmetic and named-load nodes now carry the pre-operation Lantern
  continuation: accumulator plus exactly the registers live before that
  bytecode. A single backward transfer per block reuses the authoritative
  liveness effects, avoiding all-register snapshots. The specialization plan
  emits a compact point table + recovery byte stream only for guarded nodes;
  constants embed directly and other entries reference pre-node SSA values.
  A bounds-checked verifier rejects mismatched lowerings/assumptions, malformed
  state ranges, unavailable ValueIds, duplicate register slots, corrupt tags, and
  truncated streams without panicking. Stable physical spill homes and register
  allocation are recorded in the follow-ups below; runtime frame reconstruction
  remains gated.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark representation selection (2026-07-16).** A pure verified pass now
  assigns every SSA result and use either tagged or int32 form. Checked
  arithmetic and compatible block arguments keep int32 values unboxed; tagged
  consumers box explicitly, while tagged-to-int32 checks are legal only on
  frame-state-owning speculative nodes. Phi selection monotonically falls back
  to tagged when any incoming edge is not already int32, so CFG edges never
  acquire ownerless deopt guards. The verifier recomputes the plan and rejects
  malformed node/parameter/edge ranges, overlapping or orphaned input entries,
  inconsistent lowerings, and corrupt conversions without panicking. Double
  representation stays deferred until executable lowering measures a need.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark physical deopt homes (2026-07-16).** Logical SSA recoveries now
  lower into stable definition-time spill homes for only the values referenced
  by deopt frame states. Tagged and int32 homes use separate regions, giving a
  future stack walker one precise tagged-region boundary; repeated recoveries
  reuse the same slot. A second compact stream records tagged loads, int32
  loads with boxing recipes, and embedded immediates. Allocation-free
  materialization produces Lantern's NaN-boxed `Value`s, while shared
  bounds-checked codec primitives reject corrupt homes, counts, tags, offsets,
  and spill indices without panicking. Native frame emission and runtime
  replacement remain gated on register allocation and guard-exit codegen.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark graph/Lantern differential evaluator (2026-07-16).** A bounded
  pre-codegen evaluator now runs the pure SSA subset with block-argument CFG
  transfer, representation conversions, checked int32 guards, and
  definition-time physical-home writes. In-range checked arithmetic returns
  the same NaN-boxed bits as Lantern. Overflow decodes the physical stream,
  reconstructs the pre-operation accumulator/live registers, resumes Lantern
  at that bytecode offset, and matches a full Lantern run's promoted Double.
  Parallel edge assignment avoids phi clobbering, corrupt metadata remains a
  normal error, and a mandatory step limit bounds loops. Generic effectful
  operations stay explicit fallback boundaries until rooted execution and IC
  guards land.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark abstract register allocation (2026-07-16).** A deterministic
  CFG-scheduled linear scan now assigns bounded target-independent GP register
  ids and separate tagged/int32 spill regions. Constants and folded values
  rematerialize; non-overlapping ordinary spills reuse slots after the stable
  deopt-home prefix; a recoverable value that spills reuses its exact home.
  Same-position operands remain live through result definition, preventing a
  future emitter from clobbering an input. The verifier independently
  recomputes live ranges, evictions, locations, and frame counts and rejects
  malformed ownership, homes, register ids, or spill indices. AArch64 register
  mapping and edge moves land in the follow-up below; frame emission and
  guard-exit code remain gated.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark AArch64 physical lowering plan (2026-07-16).** Abstract registers
  now map to six callee-saved value registers (`x23`-`x28`) beside pinned realm,
  Lantern-frame, register-file, and spill-base registers. The native frame
  places tagged 8-byte slots before int32 4-byte slots, aligns to 16 bytes, and
  rejects offsets outside the first emitter's direct scaled addressing range.
  CFG block arguments lower through a deterministic parallel-move resolver:
  leaves run first, `x9` breaks cycles and fan-out safely, and boxing remains on
  the final move. The verifier rebuilds the frame, locations, edge ranges, and
  move stream. Prologue/epilogue, tagged-slot initialization, safepoints,
  instructions, guard exits, and executable installation remain gated.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark native frame emission (2026-07-16).** The first AArch64 emitter
  transactionally writes a full AAPCS64 prologue/epilogue: FP/LR and `x19`-`x28`
  are preserved, aligned spill reservation is split at the 12-bit immediate
  limit, entry ABI values are pinned, and every tagged slot receives
  non-pointer `undefined` bits before a future safepoint can observe it. Golden
  words pin the convention and a native arm64 executable-memory test enters the
  frame, reads an initialized spill through `x22`, restores SP, and returns the
  exact NaN-boxed value. SSA nodes, guards, helper calls, code ownership, and
  tier-up remain disabled.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark typed moves and folded native returns (2026-07-16).** Physical
  moves now carry source/destination representations through cycle resolution
  and code emission. Registers and separate tagged/int32 stack regions move
  through reserved transfer/tag scratch registers; int32 boxing preserves the
  raw low word and adds Cynic's NaN tag. Offset and kind mismatches roll back
  normally. Non-heap constant-pool values may rematerialize, while heap-valued
  entries return `UnsupportedConstant` rather than embedding an unrooted GC
  pointer. A folded `1 + 2` graph now runs through all optimizer plans and
  native AArch64 frame code and returns the exact `Value.fromInt32(3)` bits.
  Non-folded nodes and guards remain disabled.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark checked execution and guard exits (2026-07-16).** A verified
  AArch64 graph compiler now schedules the first non-folded subset: checked
  int32 add/sub/mul, constant and dynamic-int32 control flow, resolved edge
  moves, definition-time stable-home writes, and normal frame returns. Signed
  overflow and multiplication's full-width/negative-zero conditions branch to
  cold exits. Each exit compiles the physical recovery stream into direct
  loads, int32 boxing, and stores of the pre-operation accumulator, live
  registers, and bytecode offset into the existing Lantern `CallFrame`, then
  returns `resume_interp`; bailout allocates nothing and calls no helper.
  Native arm64 differential tests cover all three arithmetic operations,
  overflow, `-0`, dynamic zero/nonzero branches, and resumed/full-Lantern
  equality. Generic unsupported graphs roll emission back transactionally.
  At this checkpoint Ohaimark remained test-only; live property guards follow
  below.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Ohaimark live property-IC execution (2026-07-16).** Specialized own-data,
  prototype-data, and frozen synthetic-accessor named loads now execute on
  AArch64. Generated code validates the snapshot's arena-stable shape, slot,
  and revision facts against the chunk-owned live `LoadICCell`; GC-managed
  prototypes and synthetic values are read only through that cell. Receiver
  shape, prototype identity, holder shape, realm revision, mode, and cell
  invalidation misses use the existing allocation-free exit to restore the
  pre-operation Lantern frame. Native tests install code before mutating live
  state, cover inline and overflow slots, and compare resumed Lantern results;
  cold generic loads still reject transactionally. Property mechanics live in
  `runtime/ohaimark/property_codegen_aarch64.zig` so graph codegen remains
  focused. Ohaimark remains test-only pending safepoints, executable-code
  ownership, and disabled-by-default tier-up.
  See [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Generational GC.** A JSC-Riptide-style non-moving
  generational collector — store-site routing, generation header
  bits, a write barrier + remembered set, `collectYoung` with
  promotion-by-relink, and a two-tier (alloc-count + byte)
  trigger. See [docs/handbook/gc.md](handbook/gc.md).
- **ConsString ropes.** `JSString` carries a flat/cons
  discriminator; `concat` is O(1) and flattens lazily on first
  observable use — removes the O(N²) `buildString +=` blow-up.
- **Cross-engine micro-bench harness** (`tools/bench-cross.sh`) —
  interpreter-tier comparison against QuickJS-NG / V8 /
  SpiderMonkey / Hermes with their JITs disabled. Phase 2 of
  [docs/benchmarking.md](benchmarking.md).

**In progress.**

- **Profile-driven hotspot list** — `samply` over a test262
  runtime sweep, top-N hot functions. Drives what gets optimized
  next. Driver lives at `tools/profile.sh`; slash command at
  `/profile`.
- **`/perf` micro-bench harness** — `zig build bench` builds a
  dedicated ReleaseFast `cynic-bench` binary and times the fixed
  micro-bench suite in `bench/micros/`, median of 10, diffing
  per-fixture wall time + RSS against the prior `bench-results.md`
  baseline. Phase 1 of [docs/benchmarking.md](benchmarking.md).

**Interpreter-tier parity with QuickJS-NG — reached.**

The cross-engine harness (interpreter tier, JITs off) now puts
Cynic at or ahead of QuickJS-NG across the micro suite — including
`prop_access` (13 vs 16 ms), once the largest gap at ~3× slower,
closed by the inline property-shape caches below. (Live numbers in
[`bench-cross-results.md`](../bench-cross-results.md); that file and
`bench-results.md` are the source of truth — this narrative records
how the wins landed.) QuickJS-NG is the fairest non-JIT peer;
matching the JIT engines at full speed is a separate track (see
*Proper Tail Calls* and the JIT tiers). The shipped work that got
here, largest-win-first:

1. **Inline property-shape caches** — the single biggest win.
   **Monomorphic shipped** — `lda_property`, `sta_property`, and
   `call_method` each carry a chunk-local IC cell; the fast path
   is a shape pointer compare and a `slots[slot]` load on reads,
   a slot write + bag mirror on writes, and a cached-callee match
   on call sites. `prop_access` measured at **−66 %** (48.94 →
   16.47 ms), `prop_write` at **−63 %** (92.24 → 33.70 ms). Every
   major engine built this first — V8 hidden classes, JSC
   structures, SM shape trees. Remaining: polymorphic dispatch
   (a small chain on the cell when the receiver's shape varies
   between two or three callers — most engines cap at ~4 entries
   before degrading to megamorphic / dictionary). Worth doing
   once a real workload surfaces a polymorphic site that's
   currently slow.

2. **Leaner `JSObject` allocation — shipped.**
   `@sizeOf(JSObject)` dropped 960 → 512 bytes, then to 400 (-58 %
   from the original) as the wasm host backings, Date/boxed-
   primitive/capability/generator state, the Promise.finally
   machinery, and the class private-state fields followed the same
   route. Achieved by moving every cold field (`accessors`, `private_*`,
   `namespace_*`, `map_data`, `set_data`, `promise_*`,
   `weak_ref_target`, `finalization_cells`, `array_buffer`,
   `typed_view`, `data_view`) behind a lazy
   `?*JSObjectExtension` pointer. Plain `{a, b}` literals now
   pay a single null pointer instead of the multi-kilobyte cold
   state. A follow-up slab pool for `JSObject` headers (`9871171`)
   replaced the per-allocation `libsystem_malloc` round-trip with
   an O(1) free-list pop. Combined: `object_alloc` 232 ns/alloc
   → ~159 ns/alloc — **-32 % per allocation** vs the original
   baseline.

   **Literal-shape template cache — shipped** (`22d2028`).
   `make_object` for an object-literal sequence carries a
   chunk-side template index; first execution walks the keys
   via `ShapeTree.transition` and caches the result; subsequent
   executions stamp `obj.shape = cached_shape` directly and the
   follow-up `def_property` opcodes skip the per-key transition
   lookup. V8 / JSC's "literal boilerplate" pattern.

   **Bag-mirror skip on shape-stable writes — shipped**
   (`8b98ba0`). `sta_property`'s IC hot path skips the bag write
   on a shape-stable object. `JSObject.get` / `.hasOwn` were
   already shape-first (`4133c7f`, `4b06eb4`).

   **Lazy property bag — shipped** (`0cab149` + `6d96854`,
   Phase 3 of [docs/lazy-property-bag.md](lazy-property-bag.md)).
   Drops the per-property `properties.put` mirror on shape-stable
   writes; the slot becomes the source of truth and the bag stays
   unallocated for the fresh-object case. `object_alloc` ~ -16 %
   (55.38 → 47 ms) — Cynic now leads QuickJS-NG on this fixture
   (47 vs 54 ms). Trades a few % on hot reads (`prop_access`,
   `arith_loop`) for the alloc win; recoverable via the IC
   shape-gate work tracked separately.

   Remaining structural wins on `object_alloc`:

   - **Brand-bool bit-packing.** ~10 single-byte bools on
     `JSObject` (`has_error_data`, `is_raw_json`,
     `is_module_namespace`, `is_weak_ref`, `is_arguments_exotic`,
     `proxy_revoked`, `proxy_callable`, `promise_already_resolved`,
     `has_array_buffer_data`, `is_sparse`) could pack into a
     single `u32` flags word. Saves ~10-16 bytes per `JSObject`
     after alignment — marginal; defer until measurement shows
     it matters.

3. **Packed `JSArray` element-kinds.** V8 / JSC distinguish
   `PackedSmiElements` (i32-flat), `PackedDoubleElements`
   (f64-flat), and `PackedElements` (Value-flat). Cynic stays on
   `PackedElements` everywhere (`elements: ArrayList(Value)`).
   The interpreter-tier payoff is small without a JIT — the
   kind-check dispatch overhead eats most of the per-element
   memory savings, and Hermes (the interpreter-tier engine Cynic
   most resembles) deliberately doesn't do this. Worth doing
   once a tier speculates on element kinds — Ohaimark territory
   (docs/jit.md §5); Bistromath alone doesn't move it.

4. **Interpreter-core tuning for `arith_loop`** — Cynic is
   already within ~10 % of QuickJS-NG here; the remaining
   distance is to JSC's hand-written-assembly LLInt. Closing that
   without a JIT is deep, diminishing-returns micro-tuning of the
   dispatch core — lowest priority, and the point where a
   baseline JIT becomes the better investment.

**Planned — interpreter-tier optimizations beyond ICs.**

The IC arc (item 1 above) covered the biggest single chunk —
property access. Beyond ICs, several classical interpreter
optimizations remain on the table. Stack-ranked by expected
impact for an interpreter-only engine; numbers are estimates,
not measurements.

5. **Profile-gated super-instructions — infrastructure shipped.**
   Static and dynamic opcode pair/trigram telemetry now identifies
   candidates; existing retained fusions include compare+branch,
   property-call, counter-loop, `add_smi`, and `add_to_int32`
   shapes. New opcodes must clear a paired wall-time gate, not just
   reduce dispatch. A loose-equality+branch family cut Richards
   dispatch by 4.34% but regressed paired non-JIT wall time by 3.8%,
   so it was reverted. Continue only where profiles show a candidate
   and the end-to-end benchmark improves.

6. **Counter-loop specialization — shipped.** `loop_inc_lt`
   opcode fuses the seven-opcode `add 1 + star + ldar + lt +
   jmp_if_true` tail of a canonical for-loop into one dispatch.
   The compiler pattern-matches `for (let i = INT; i < INT; i++)
   BODY` on the `ForStmt` AST and emits the fused form when the
   body has no closure (per-iter env elision precondition) and
   doesn't reassign `i`. The counter and bound live in plain
   registers — `i` is promoted off the env via a one-shot
   `is_register` binding flag, so body reads compile to `ldar
   r_counter`. Int32 fast path + slow fallback through
   `arith.incOrDec` / `relational` for non-int32 operands.
   Hermes calls the same shape `JLessNLong`; V8 Ignition has a
   `Jump…IncIfTrue` family. `arith_loop` measured at **−61 %**
   (80.10 → 31.55 ms) — overtakes QuickJS-NG (77 ms) on the
   cross-engine bench.

7. **Peephole + CFG/liveness re-emission — shipped foundation.**
   Emit-time specializations cover common constants, low registers,
   arithmetic idioms, calls, and comparisons; jump threading runs
   over logical branch patches. Finalized chunks get CFG/liveness-
   guarded dead-store re-emission and accumulator-aware adjacent
   store/reload forwarding; a load that is a branch, switch, or
   handler entry is retained. Re-emission repairs relaxed branches,
   source positions, exception handlers, and switch targets. More
   rewrites remain profile-driven; unknown register effects fail
   closed and merely skip liveness-dependent passes.

8. **Frame register pool — shipped** (`b38f125`). Every
   JS-function call site (`call`, `call_method`, `new_call`,
   `tail_call`, `tail_call_method`) used to `allocator.alloc(
   Value, max(register_count, argc))` for the callee's register
   file and free it on frame pop — a libc malloc + free per
   call. Pool keyed by register_count amortises both. Surfaced
   by the cross-engine bench (`method_call` /
   `class_instantiate` running 2.2× behind QuickJS-NG); the
   pool closes most of that gap.

9. **String interning for property keys — measured dead-end
   (2026-06).** Prototyped behind `-Dintern-keys`: compile-time
   property-name constants interned into a per-heap atom table,
   `Shape` comparing keys by atom identity (pointer compare) with a
   byte fallback. Correct and fully transparent (full test262 pass set
   byte-identical flag on/off, `--jit` differential exact), but the
   layout-controlled macro A/B (one flag-off baseline vs three
   independently-perturbed flag-on builds) showed **no reproducible
   win** — the deltas were code-layout noise (deltablue's sign flipped
   across perturbations; crypto, which barely touches property access,
   moved the same amount). On 3–8-byte identifiers the per-node
   `std.mem.eql` is already cheap, and interning never touches the
   O(depth) walk length or the bag `Wyhash` in
   `hasAccessor`/`ownDataContains` that dominate the megamorphic-miss
   cluster. Reverted; the full write-up + numbers are in
   [interned-keys.md](interned-keys.md) §11. Any future property-lookup
   work should target those two costs (per-shape hash index;
   shape-first bag probes), not atom identity. The computed-property
   IC (`obj[k]` with hot constant `k`) shipped without interning —
   it caches the key bytes inline ([inline-caches.md](inline-caches.md)
   "Computed-property read + write IC").

10. **SMI fast paths in arithmetic / comparison opcodes.**
    Cynic uses NaN-boxing so an int32 value is identifiable
    by tag. The `add` / `sub` / `mul` / `lt` / `eq` opcodes
    can check `(lhs.isInt32() and rhs.isInt32())` early and
    take a non-overflow integer path before falling back to
    the full numeric-tower coercion. Some opcodes already
    have this; auditing for completeness is the work.

11. **Direct-threaded dispatch.** Pre-decode each chunk's
    bytecode into a list of `(handler_fn_ptr, operand_bytes)`
    pairs at chunk-finalize time; the dispatch loop indexes
    that list directly, skipping the opcode-byte → switch-arm
    indirection. JSC's LLInt uses this pattern. Significant
    rewrite — a chunk grows a parallel "decoded" representation,
    every opcode handler becomes addressable via `&handler`,
    and `Chunk` ownership/layout shifts. Worth it only after
    everything else is exhausted. The interpreter perf
    ceiling without a JIT.

12. **Inline small function bodies at bytecode-emit time.**
    For non-recursive, non-escaping, small (<N bytecode bytes)
    functions, inline the body at the call site. Bytecode-
    level inlining (no JIT speculation required). Niche but
    real for hot helper functions.

13. **Environment hoisting (more sites).** `for-of` and C-style
    `for` already hoist the per-iteration env when the body has
    no closure capture (shipped). `while` / `do-while` / classic
    `for` blocks with no closures are candidate sites for the
    same analysis. Each hoist avoids one `allocateEnvironment`
    per iteration.

14. **Loop unrolling / loop-invariant code motion.** Bytecode-
    level unrolling pays icache cost on bigger bodies; rarely
    a win in practice for an interpreter. LICM needs escape
    analysis (JIT-territory). Both skipped unless a profile
    shows a specific workload that warrants the cost.

15. **Tail call optimization** (§15.10 / PTC) — *shipped*.
    See the *Proper Tail Calls* section below for the
    implementation note and the feature-flag gate.

The cross-engine bench dictates the order. If `prop_access` /
`prop_write` / call-heavy workloads sit at parity with
QuickJS-NG post-IC, the next bottleneck is `arith_loop` (pure
dispatch + arithmetic throughput) — items 5, 6, 7, 10. If
allocation-heavy workloads dominate, items 8, 9.

**GC latency — incremental marking + lazy sweep shipped; mark CPU at the non-moving floor.**

- **Incremental major mark + lazy sweep.** The major cycle no
  longer stop-the-world marks/sweeps the mature set: the mark is
  sliced across safe-points behind a Dijkstra incremental-update
  barrier and the termination sweep is sliced too, cutting the max
  GC pause **~800 ms → ~1 ms** on a 2M-object heap. The major's
  *mark CPU* on a large stable retained set is now the floor for a
  non-moving collector — the generational-incremental major that
  would skip the unchanged-old re-trace was explored and closed
  ([docs/gc-generational-major.md](gc-generational-major.md), commit
  efe52c7d): a non-moving mark-sweep can't reclaim old garbage
  without re-tracing it. The three escapes were then scoped — a region
  heap (**Immix**) was killed by a profile showing the per-object pools
  aren't the bottleneck
  ([docs/gc-immix-rearchitecture.md](gc-immix-rearchitecture.md)), and
  **reference counting** was prototyped and measured a no-go (the store
  barrier taxes common operations +7–26% for a narrow retained-set-only
  win, [docs/gc-reference-counting.md](gc-reference-counting.md)) —
  leaving only off-thread *concurrent* marking, a poor fit for a
  single-threaded mutator. The broad GC win is banked; the frontier is

## Proper Tail Calls (PTC) — shipped

ES2015 §15.10 (with §14.6 PrepareForTailCall) — function calls
*in tail position* (`return f(x)`, the last expression of an
arrow body, `return cond ? f() : g()`, etc.) reuse the caller's
stack frame instead of pushing a fresh one. Spec wording is
mandatory; in practice only **JavaScriptCore** had been shipping
it. Cynic is the second.

**On by default.** No feature flag — the compiler always emits
`tail_call` / `tail_call_method` at statically-detectable tail
positions. The test262 fixtures under `language/*/tco-*` and the
`tail-call-optimization` frontmatter tag run as part of the
main ECMA-262 sweep.

### Cross-engine status (2026)

| Engine | PTC | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| JavaScriptCore | ✅ | Shipped 2016, still in. Bun inherits. |
| **Cynic** | ✅ | Shipped on by default. |
| V8 | ❌ | Implemented briefly behind a flag (2016), removed. Cited reasons: lost stack frames break dev-tools / `Error.stack`, hot-path cost on every call site, and the [STC counter-proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ptc-syntax) wanting explicit `return continue f()` syntax. |
| SpiderMonkey | ❌ | [Tracking bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188320) open since 2015. |
| Hermes / QuickJS / XS / Boa | ❌ | None. |

### Implementation

1. **Static tail-position detection** runs in the bytecode
   compiler — an inherited `in_tail_position` flag set by
   `compileReturn` and the `ArrowFunction` concise-body path,
   propagated through the §15.10.1-transparent expression types
   (parenthesized, conditional consequent / alternate, logical
   `&&` / `||` / `??` rhs, comma's last operand). Every other
   expression type clears the flag for its sub-expressions.
2. **`tail_call` / `tail_call_method` opcodes** (`src/bytecode/op.zig`).
   Operand layouts mirror `call` and `call_method`. The
   interpreter handler frees the current frame's register file,
   allocates the callee's, copies args, and overwrites the
   frame's chunk / ip / env / this / new.target / home /
   owning_module in place — no new push, no matching pop.
   Exotic callees (proxy, bound, native, generator, async) fall
   back to ordinary call semantics; the unconditionally-emitted
   `return_` immediately following the `tail_call` in the
   bytecode propagates the result.
3. **Disqualifiers** consulted at the call-emission site in
   `shouldEmitTailCall` (`src/bytecode/compiler.zig`):
   enclosing function is async or generator; `finally_chain`
   non-null (try-with-finally that would never run);
   `try_with_handler_depth > 0` (try-with-catch whose handler
   would be lost on frame reuse); any enclosing loop owes an
   `IteratorClose` (for-of with an open iterator).
4. **`Error.stack` impact**: a tail-called function disappears
   from the chain. Stack traces become harder to read. This is
   the spec-prescribed cost.

Cynic shipped PTC tractably for reasons that didn't apply to V8 /
SpiderMonkey at the time: no JIT yet (no TurboFan / Ion retrofit
cost — Bistromath then arrived PTC-aware: self-recursive tail
calls compile as jump-to-entry, the rest tier down, docs/jit.md
§12), no sloppy mode (no §15.10.1 carve-outs), eval off by
default (no §15.10.1 direct-eval interaction on the default
posture), no `with` (drops out of the spec walk), no DevTools
surface today (no installed expectation that `Error.stack` shows
eliminated frames).

## Robustness & host-safety

The invariant: untrusted JS never aborts the host — any input yields
a normal completion or a catchable JS exception, never a panic /
`unreachable` / segfault / numeric-cast trap / unbounded growth. See
[handbook/host-safety.md](handbook/host-safety.md) for the mechanisms
and the per-builtin checklist; this section tracks status.

**Shipped**

- **Saturating numeric casts** — §7.1.5 / §7.1.20 sites route through
  `doubleToI64Saturating` instead of trapping on out-of-range user
  doubles; length×size multiplies guard against overflow. Began with
  eight Number/String/Array/TypedArray sites, extended to the
  array-like iterator and ShadowRealm-arity paths.
- **Recursion bounds** — parser nesting and `JSON.parse` depth throw
  `RangeError` instead of overflowing the host stack.
- **Native re-entry stack guard** — `nearNativeStackLimit()` throws
  `RangeError` before a native→JS re-entry (accessor getter, array
  callback, `Reflect.apply`, Proxy trap, promise drain) overflows the
  host stack; precise per-thread bounds on macOS + Linux.
- **GC rooting under re-entry** — the `HandleScope` contract (see
  [handbook/gc.md](handbook/gc.md)); the Object / Set / Promise
  accessor + set-like + aggregator paths root the values they hold
  across a JS re-entry.
- **`test262-gc-stress` CI** — ReleaseSafe + `--gc-threshold=1` across
  the GC-mutation-heavy buckets, on every PR, so a missed root is a
  deterministic crash pre-merge.

**Planned**

- **CI lint for the cast/abort class** — fail the build on a new
  `@intFromFloat` / `@intCast`-from-float / bare `@panic` /
  `unreachable` reachable from `builtins/`, so the class can't
  regress silently.
- **Fuzzer harness** — structure-aware over the parser, `JSON.parse`,
  and Perlex (ReleaseSafe target so a trap surfaces as a crash).
- **Make gc-stress gating** — promote from advisory once the
  occasional `--threads=4` gc1 flake is understood, so a real
  use-after-free blocks rather than annotates.

## Future work (post-strict-only-runtime)

- **Bistromath** — baseline JIT (T1). Direct opcode-to-native,
  inline caches for property access. Modeled on JSC Baseline /
  V8 Sparkplug. **Shipped** (M5, 2026-06) and on by default —
  `--no-jit` opts out; coverage, gates, and measured wins are
  tracked in docs/jit.md's delivery-order section.
- **Ohaimark** — optimizing JIT (T2). IR (SSA), type speculation
  from inline caches, deopt back to Lantern on guard failure.
  Modeled on JSC DFG / V8 Maglev / SpiderMonkey Warp. The feedback snapshot,
  block-argument SSA, initial specialization and representation planners, and
  logical plus stable-spill physical deopt metadata and a bounded differential
  evaluator, abstract register/spill allocation, and AArch64 frame/edge
  lowering plus native frame entry/exit, typed moves, and folded returns ship;
  checked int32 arithmetic/control and direct Lantern-frame guard exits now
  execute in tests, as do live-cell own/prototype/synthetic named loads.
  Safepoints, code ownership, and runtime tier-up remain planned. See
  [ohaimark.md](ohaimark.md).
- **Spasm** — wasm baseline JIT (T1), Sarcasm's compiled tier.
  Single-pass over the validated module + branch side-table,
  Liftoff / Wizard-SPC shape; buries *asm* like its parent. The
  complete scalar numeric ISA — i32/i64 and f32/f64 ALU, comparisons,
  div/rem with catchable traps, the memory family (incl. bulk-memory
  fill/copy/size), and every int↔float conversion (trapping and
  saturating) — plus globals and structured control flow ships and is
  default-on for wasm; calls, tables, and SIMD are next.

  The architecture for all three tiers — the shared codegen
  substrate and the JS↔wasm call-boundary fast path included — is
  pinned in [jit.md](jit.md) (prior-art survey, frame-identity
  rule, per-signature boundary thunks, executable-memory
  mechanics, verification gates, M5 delivery order).

- **Embedder build flags** — advertised, V8/QJS/Duktape-style
  `-D<name>` options that comptime-strip optional surfaces from a
  Cynic library build. Today the strip works implicitly via Zig
  DCE (an entry module that doesn't reference `disasm` / the AST
  printer / `installTestGlobals` doesn't pull them into the binary)
  and via the runtime install-gate (`Realm.installBuiltins` is
  production-clean; `installTestGlobals` is the explicit demo /
  test opt-in). Embedders generally prefer an explicit contract
  over "trust the dead-code eliminator." Tier-1 flags would gate
  three debug surfaces — `embed-disasm`, `embed-ast-printer`,
  `embed-test-globals` — each `@compileError`-ing inside the
  stripped function so misuse fails at the embedder's compile
  time. Defaults stay `true` (CLI + playground shape preserved);
  embedders opt out. Tier-2 (Temporal, Sarcasm, the typed-array
  family) is bigger surface and lands incrementally once the
  pattern is proven. JIT-tier strips (`embed-jit`, `embed-spasm`)
  slot into the same namespace, owned by the JIT track.

## Considered and declined

- **Constant-time / timing-attack-resistant mode.** No source
  language exposes a constant-time *mode for JavaScript* — JIT,
  GC, and megamorphic dispatch destroy any source-level CT
  discipline before it reaches silicon. The only web-platform CT
  work that survives compilation is **CT-Wasm** (POPL '19;
  [`WebAssembly/constant-time`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/constant-time)),
  where secret `s32`/`s64` types make branching, memory-indexing,
  or `div`/`rem` on a secret a *type error* rather than something
  the engine papers over. That model is the only one worth
  copying, but it is pre-shipping, has zero mainstream-engine
  adoption (the lone implementation is a PLSysSec V8 fork), and
  applies to WASM, not the ECMAScript surface Cynic targets.
  Building it here would mean inventing a surface, not conforming
  to one — so it's out until there's a stable proposal and real
  demand. Mainstream engines (V8, JSC, SpiderMonkey) don't make
  user code constant-time either; they bound the *attacker's
  clock* (coarsened `performance.now()`, `SharedArrayBuffer`
  gated behind COOP+COEP cross-origin isolation) and isolate the
  process. If a security-conscious embedder ever needs it, the
  honest, cheap answer is a posture decision Cynic can make as a
  non-browser host — coarse-by-default timer resolution and no
  `SharedArrayBuffer` nanosecond-timer escape hatch — plus a
  `crypto.timingSafeEqual`-style primitive (Node/Deno expose one;
  browser SubtleCrypto does not), not a CT *mode*.
