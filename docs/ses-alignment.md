# SES alignment

Status: **the hardened-default baseline ships.** Every realm starts with frozen
primordials, `harden()`, and the override-mistake fix; `--unhardened` opts out
atomically. Runtime code construction is a separate, shipped capability gate
(`--allow=eval`). Compartments and ambient-state taming remain deferred.

This is the current policy reference and the durable delivery record. Read the
opening status and the checklist for current behavior; the migration phases
preserve how that behavior landed. Sister docs:
[multi-realm.md](multi-realm.md), [inline-caches.md](inline-caches.md), and
[lazy-property-bag.md](lazy-property-bag.md).

## Why now — the position statement

Cynic began strict-only, eval-off by default, and Annex-B-rejected: a
SES-friendly baseline. That baseline alone is not distinctive; modern edge
hosts can also refuse dynamic code. The material policy difference is that a
Cynic realm is already hardened when user code starts.

**Frozen primordials by default** turns SES-friendly into
**SES-native**. The competitor on this axis isn't Workers — it's
"Node + `@endo/ses` + `lockdown()`". Cynic offers the same
guarantees without the userland import, without the lockdown
ceremony, without the configuration. That's the differentiator.

The trade-off: **monkey-patching primordials stops working out of
the box**. Code that polyfills `Array.prototype.flat`, stubs
`Date.now`, or proxies a built-in's prototype gets rejected by
default. Users who actually need that flip `--unhardened` to
disable the whole SES posture.

## Positioning — hardened by default, WebAssembly stacked

WebAssembly being available by default in the CLI does not relax the SES
posture. The relevant boundaries are different:

- `eval` and dynamic Function constructors compile source strings directly
  into the JavaScript realm, so the CLI still requires `--allow=eval`.
- Wasm bytes pass a typed validator and execute in Sarcasm/Spasm. Realm fuel,
  interrupt hooks, and memory ceilings now cover that execution and its
  storage, so the standard `WebAssembly.*` surface is enabled in the CLI.
- A direct embedder can still deny dynamic Wasm bytes with
  `Realm.allow_wasm_compile = false` (the default for `Realm.init`). That
  HostEnsureCanCompileWasmBytes policy leaves trusted/predecoded modules and
  ordinary `Memory` / `Table` / `Global` / `Tag` / `Exception` construction
  available.

Frozen primordials, `harden()`, the override-mistake fix, and
`--unhardened` are unchanged. WebAssembly remains an additive execution
surface rather than a switch to mutable, general-purpose JavaScript defaults.

## What SES `lockdown()` does (the full checklist)

The `@endo/ses` reference defines SES operationally. Mapping each
guarantee against Cynic's status:

| # | SES requirement | Cynic today | This doc covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ban `eval` / `new Function(string)` family | ✅ default (gated by `--allow=eval`) | Phase 4 |
| 2 | Strict mode only, no sloppy code paths | ✅ permanent | — |
| 3 | No Annex B (HTML comments, legacy octal, `with`, etc.) | ✅ permanent | — |
| 4 | **Freeze all primordials at realm init** | ✅ shipped | Phase 1 |
| 5 | **`harden()` global** — recursive deep freeze | ✅ shipped | Phase 2 |
| 6 | **Override-mistake fix** — data props on frozen prototypes become accessor pairs that allow instance shadowing | ✅ shipped | Phase 3 |
| 7 | **`Compartment` class** — isolated realm-like sandboxes | ❌ — TC39 Stage 1; the multi-realm substrate ships (per-realm intrinsics/globals, `ShadowRealm`, per-realm teardown), the `Compartment` surface waits | Deferred |
| 8 | Tame ambient state (`Math.random`, `Date.now`, …) | ❌ | Deferred (needs Compartments) |
| 9 | Tame error stacks | partial — minimal surface today | Phase 4 (small) |
| 10 | Tame RegExp legacy globals | ✅ explicitly out | — |
| 11 | **Frozen `globalThis`** | ✅ shipped | Phase 1 (folded in) |
| 12 | Whitelisted intrinsic shapes | mostly — Cynic ships only spec-defined surface | — |

Phases 1-3 + 11 land "SES baseline by default" — the meaningful
position. Compartments (7) require multi-realm support which Cynic
explicitly punts; revisit when a real compartment user arrives or
multi-realm shows up for another reason. Phase 4 (tame error stacks)
is small but has marginal value without Compartments — defer until
the rest is shipped and measured.

## What gets frozen (Phase 1)

Walk every reachable intrinsic from realm init and apply:
- `[[Extensible]] = false`
- Every data property → `{ writable: false, configurable: false }`
- Every accessor → `{ configurable: false }` (`get` / `set` stay
  the same callables, which themselves get frozen recursively)

Starts at `realm.intrinsics.object_prototype` and walks out through
every constructor, prototype, method, getter, setter, well-known
symbol. Cycle-safe via a memoization set (Object.prototype's
constructor → Object → Object.prototype is the canonical cycle).

Also frozen: `globalThis` itself — its named bindings become
non-writable / non-configurable. New global assignments stop
working in default mode.

**Not frozen** (these stay mutable per spec):
- User-allocated objects (every `{}`, `new` invocation, array
  literal, etc.)
- The globalThis-as-environment-record bindings created by
  top-level `let` / `const` / `var` in user scripts
- `Realm.evaluateScript`-injected modules' top-level bindings

The freeze fires **once per realm**, as the last step of
`intrinsics.install(realm)` after every builtin is wired. New
intrinsics installed by future built-ins after that point would
not be frozen — the install order matters; new builtins land
before the freeze, not after.

## `harden(value)` (Phase 2)

A global builtin that recursively freezes a value (and its
prototype chain, methods, etc.). Returns the original (mutated)
value.

Spec from `@endo/ses`:
1. If `value` is a primitive, return it
2. If `value` is already in the in-progress set, return (cycle break)
3. Add `value` to the in-progress set
4. For each own property descriptor:
   - If it's a data descriptor, recursively `harden(d.value)`
   - If it's an accessor descriptor, recursively `harden(d.get)` and `harden(d.set)`
5. `harden(Object.getPrototypeOf(value))`
6. `Object.freeze(value)`

Implementation in Zig (~100-150 lines), exposed on `globalThis` as
a non-configurable, non-writable property (it freezes itself
through being part of the intrinsic freeze pass).

Userland equivalent on every other engine is `import { harden }
from '@endo/ses'`. Cynic ships it natively.

## Override-mistake fix (Phase 3)

ECMAScript §10.1.9 OrdinarySetWithOwnDescriptor: assigning to an
own property that exists *only* on a frozen prototype:
- Strict mode: TypeError
- Sloppy mode: silent no-op

Cynic is always strict, so the current behaviour throws:

```js
const proto = Object.freeze({ x: 1 });
const obj = Object.create(proto);
obj.x = 2;   // TypeError
```

The "mistake": the user almost certainly meant to **shadow** the
prototype's `x` on the instance, creating an own property
`{ x: 2 }`. The spec says no because the prototype's descriptor is
non-writable, and §10.1.9 rejects the shadow.

SES's fix: when freezing a prototype, replace each data property
with an **accessor pair**:
- `get` returns the original value
- `set` calls `Reflect.defineProperty(this, key, { value, writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: true })` — which creates the shadow on the receiver

Result: assignment-to-frozen-proto-prop succeeds as instance
shadowing instead of throwing. The prototype's value is still
globally immutable; instances can have their own values.

This is spec-conforming because accessor setters get called
through OrdinarySet, not through OrdinarySetWithOwnDescriptor's
non-writable rejection path. The behaviour matches what `@endo/ses`
does in its `lockdown()` implementation.

Implementation: extend the Phase 1 freezing pass to install
accessor pairs for data properties on **prototype objects only**
(not on constructors — those should stay frozen and reject
assignment). A single shared `(getter, setter)` pair can be
parameterised by the key, captured in closure.

Cost: the prototype's property access path goes from "direct slot
load" to "call the getter, which returns the slot" — a slowdown if
not optimised. The IC can still cache the getter's result if the
getter is pure (which it is for these synthetic accessors). The
fix needs care to not slow every prototype read by 2-3×.

## The `--unhardened` opt-out + `--allow=eval` (Phase 4)

SES-by-default means general-purpose JS that monkey-patches
primordials stops working in default mode. The opt-out surface
is intentionally minimal:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--unhardened` | Disables the **entire SES posture** atomically: primordials stay mutable (Phase 1 skipped), `globalThis` stays extensible, the `harden()` global is not installed (Phase 2), the override-mistake fix is skipped (Phase 3). Spec-literal `OrdinarySetWithOwnDescriptor` semantics. The single switch a user flips for full compatibility with general-purpose JS that monkey-patches `Array.prototype.X`, polyfills missing methods, or relies on the spec's "assign-to-frozen-proto throws" behaviour. |
| `--allow=eval` | Independent opt-in for `eval`, `new Function(string)`, and the `GeneratorFunction` / `AsyncFunction` / `AsyncGeneratorFunction` constructors. **Not bundled** with `--unhardened` because the two are orthogonal capabilities (a build can be unhardened yet eval-off, or hardened yet eval-on). **Shipped** — see "The eval engine" below. |

Why one umbrella switch instead of per-constraint flags:

- **SES is a coherent package** — frozen primordials + `harden()` +
  override-mistake fix are designed to work together. A user
  doesn't typically want "frozen primordials but no `harden()`"
  or "harden but no override fix"; they want either the hardened
  world or the legacy one. Atomic toggle matches the actual user
  decision.
- **One flag is easier to reason about** in CI, in embedder
  configuration, in deployment docs. Per-constraint flags
  (`--allow=primordial-mutation` / `--allow=extensible-globalThis`
  / `--allow=no-override-mistake-fix` / `--permissive` — an
  earlier iteration of this design) presented a menu where users
  would have to learn what each piece does just to know which
  ones to flip.
- **`harden()` is a capability addition**, not a restriction. It
  doesn't need a separate `--allow=*` flag because users who
  want their own `harden` just assign over `globalThis.harden`.
  Bundling it into the umbrella switch means a user who's
  rejecting the SES package also drops the Cynic-specific global
  cleanly (no leftover capability they'd have to manually undo).

Two distinct CLI verbs to keep separate:
- `--enable=<feature>` — turns on a not-yet-stable spec feature
  (`ShadowRealm`, etc.; `upsert` and `joint-iteration` graduated
  to default-on at Stage 4). Forward-looking.
- `--unhardened` — the SES-posture toggle. Backward-compatible-
  with-legacy-JS.
- `--allow=<relaxation>` — kept as a verb for restrictions that
  have meaningfully different opt-in cost than the SES package.
  Currently only `--allow=eval` lives here.

The flag values get a `realm.allow.<name>: bool` field accessed at
the relevant gate in the engine. Default false; per-flag opt-in.

## Migration phases

Each phase builds green and is gated on `zig build test` + a
filtered `--only-failing` sweep, with a full sweep at the end of
each phase.

### Phase 1 — freeze primordials at realm init (+ globalThis) — **shipped**

`intrinsics.freezePrimordials` runs as the last step of
`intrinsics.install(realm)` when `realm.hardened` is true (the
default). Walks `globalThis` and every field of
`realm.intrinsics` through `hardenWalk` — the same recursive
deep-freeze `harden(value)` uses, keeping the Phase 1 freeze
shape in lockstep with the user-facing harden idiom. Cycle-safe
via the visited pointer set already in `harden.zig`.

After the pass:
- Every reachable intrinsic object / function has
  `[[Extensible]] = false`.
- Every own data descriptor is
  `{writable: false, configurable: false}`.
- Every accessor descriptor is `{configurable: false}`.
- `globalThis` itself is non-extensible — new bare-identifier
  assignments (`globalThis.x = 1`) throw.

`canDeclareGlobalVar` / `canDeclareGlobalFunction` carry a
`hardened` parameter (threaded through from
`realm.hardened`) and skip the extensibility check when set.
Top-level `var x = 1` keeps working under the SES posture — the
host's program-level binding install is distinct from user JS
poisoning globalThis by assignment.

`--unhardened` flips `realm.hardened` to `false` before
`installBuiltins`; the freeze pass is then a no-op and the
intrinsic graph stays mutable. Test262 verification:
The main test262 phase runs with `--unhardened --allow=eval`, so fixtures that
need mutable primordials are scored with the freeze skipped.

Acknowledged gaps (inherited from `hardenWalk`):
- Array-exotic indexed slots aren't lowered into the property
  bag — none of the intrinsic objects today are array exotics
  (Array.prototype, etc. are plain objects in Cynic), so the
  gap is dormant on the intrinsic graph.
- Module Namespace objects can't be made non-extensible per
  §9.4.6.6; no intrinsic is a module namespace.
- Proxy receivers — no intrinsic is a Proxy.

**Test262 risk:** observed — handful of fixtures (those that
monkey-patch intrinsics) regress in the default hardened sweep;
the scored main sweep runs `--unhardened --allow=eval` and confirms those
fixtures pass when the freeze is skipped.

### Phase 2 — `harden()` global — **shipped**

Lives in `src/runtime/builtins/harden.zig`, installed at the end
of `intrinsics.install` (so the walk can reach the intrinsic graph
once it's wired). Native Zig — primitives pass through; objects /
functions get `extensible = false` + every own descriptor stamped
`{writable: false, configurable: false}`. Recursion walks own
property values, accessor getters / setters, and the
prototype chain. Visited set keyed by heap pointer makes the walk
cycle-safe. Three unit tests pin the contract (`harden recursively
freezes own data + nested + prototype`, `harden is cycle-safe +
returns its argument`, `harden of a primitive is a no-op`).

Known acknowledged gaps (acceptable for the MVP):
  - Module Namespace objects can't be made non-extensible per
    §9.4.6.6; skipped rather than throw.
  - Proxy receivers freeze via direct slot mutation here, not
    through the `preventExtensions` trap.
  - The walk is recursive, but every recursive entry checks the native
    stack guard; pathological depth throws a catchable `RangeError` rather
    than aborting the host.

When Phase 1 ships, the primordial freeze runs first, so
`harden(globalThis)` becomes mostly a no-op walk over already-
frozen intrinsics — the path stays correct (the visited set
short-circuits the redundant freezes).

### Phase 3 — override-mistake fix — **shipped**

`installOverrideMistakeFix` runs as Pass 2 of
`freezePrimordials`. For every prototype object reachable
through `realm.intrinsics` (every `*_prototype` field + every
constructor's `.prototype` slot), each own data descriptor is
demoted to a synthetic accessor pair: the getter returns the
captured value verbatim; the setter performs
DefineOwnProperty on the *receiver* with `{value, writable:
true, enumerable: true, configurable: true}`. Constructors,
namespace objects (`Math`, `JSON`, `Reflect`), and `globalThis`
keep their data descriptors so direct intrinsic mutation
(`Math.PI = 4`) still throws.

The `constructor` back-edge is demoted like every other data
slot. An earlier iteration left it frozen to keep
`instance.constructor` reads off the getter path, but the
override mistake classically bites on exactly that property
(`this.constructor = …` in legacy hierarchies,
`Sub.prototype.constructor = Sub` over an `Object.create`'d
primordial prototype), and `@endo/ses` lockdown's enablements
demote it on every primordial prototype for the same reason.
Reads stay cheap — the get path short-circuits on
`synth_accessor` (a pointer load, not a JS call) before any
dispatch.

The synthetic setter throws if asked to redefine on the frozen
holder (`Array.prototype.flat = badImpl`), since the accessor
slot is non-configurable. Receivers further down the prototype
chain succeed by creating the own data property — the
override-mistake fix proper.

**IC interaction.** `callJSFunction` short-circuits on
`JSFunction.synth_accessor` before allocating a call frame —
the getter is a pointer load, the setter is a property-define
op. The `lda_property` slow-path also fast-paths synthetic
getters on its hot arms (plain-object receiver,
function-receiver). Future work: extend the inline cache to
remember the captured value at the call site so the hot
`obj.toString()` read avoids the `lookupAccessor` walk entirely.

**Test262 risk:** observed — fixtures that pin built-in
function `.name` / `.length` descriptors as `configurable: true`
per §17 regress because the freeze locks them
non-configurable. These are the dominant cluster of regressions
under the `hardened` score row; the `unhardened` row
recovers them in full.

### Phase 4 — `--unhardened` flag wiring — **shipped**

Trivial — collect the gates (Phase 1 freeze, Phase 2 harden
install, Phase 3 override fix) and skip them all when
`realm.hardened == false`. Single CLI parser change + docs +
one struct field on Realm. `--allow=eval` is independent and shipped
separately.

### Phase 5 — measurement, doc updates, gh-pages

- Run the full bench suite — confirm no regression
  (the override-mistake accessor pair is the perf risk)
- Run test262 with `--unhardened` isolated as a phase, confirm
  the relaxation path keeps test fixtures that depend on
  prototype-mutation alive
- Update website (`gh-pages/index.html`) — the "Cynic says" column
  for the SES-adjacent rows gains "hardened by default"
- Update `bench-cross-results.md` if the perf moved

## Compatibility risks

Things that **stop working** by default after Phase 1:

```js
Array.prototype.flat = function() { ... };     // throws — proto frozen
Object.prototype.foo = 'bar';                  // throws
Date.now = () => 0;                            // throws (intrinsic frozen)
globalThis.x = 1;                              // throws — globalThis frozen
String.prototype.includes ??= function() {};   // throws if shipped
```

Things that **continue to work**:

```js
const obj = { a: 1 };
obj.a = 2;                                     // user-allocated, mutable
obj.b = 3;
class Foo {}; Foo.prototype.method = () => {}; // user class, mutable
const arr = [1, 2, 3]; arr.length = 0;         // user array, mutable
let x = 5; x = 10;                             // user binding, mutable
```

The dividing line: **engine-installed intrinsics are frozen; user-
allocated objects are not**. SES's whole bet is that this line is
where security matters and where compatibility costs are lowest.

## Compartments — why deferred

`Compartment` is what makes SES SES rather than "just hardened
primordials". It's the API for confining code:

```js
const c = new Compartment({ globals: { fetch: limitedFetch } });
c.evaluate('await fetch("/api")');  // only sees limitedFetch
```

**Primary reason it's postponed: `Compartment` is a TC39 *Stage 1*
proposal** ([tc39/proposal-compartments](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments)).
Stage 1 means the shape is still being explored — the constructor
options, the module-descriptor design, and the `import` hook are all
subject to change. Cynic's policy is to not ship pre-Stage-4 proposals
by default (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) "Pre-Stage-4 proposals
shipped" — only stabilising proposals graduate in), and an unstable,
churning API is the wrong thing to bake into the engine's
confinement boundary. So Compartments waits on the proposal, not on
Cynic.

The engine substrate they need has, in fact, largely landed (see
[multi-realm.md](multi-realm.md)): multiple coexisting realms with
per-realm intrinsics + globals, realm-aware free-binding / intrinsic
resolution, a shared-heap GC that marks every realm's roots, and
`ShadowRealm` (constructor + `.evaluate` + `.importValue` + the
callable boundary) with per-realm teardown. What a `Compartment`
constructor would still add on top:
- the user-visible `Compartment` class + its options object,
- a per-compartment module loader (the proposal's module
  descriptors / virtual modules — themselves Stage 1 and in flux),
- endowment plumbing (deep-frozen globals handed in at construction).

Revisit Compartments when:
1. **The proposal advances** (Stage 2+), so the API surface is stable
   enough to commit to; AND/OR
2. A real Compartment user shows up (Agoric-style high-integrity
   computation, a hardened plugin system, a host needing per-tenant
   confinement).

## Out of scope (deferred or rejected)

- **`Compartment` class** — Phase 7+ work. See above.
- **Tame ambient state** (`Math.random`, `Date.now`, etc.) — only
  useful with Compartments. SES taming is per-realm; without
  Compartments there's nothing to tame against.
- **Enforcing `lockdown()`-style intrinsic shape restrictions
  beyond freezing** — SES does extra work to remove "powerful"
  intrinsics. Cynic doesn't ship most of them anyway (`eval` /
  `Function(string)` are off unless `--allow=eval`; no `RegExp`
  legacy globals).
- **`StaticModuleRecord` / `SyntheticModuleRecord`** — module API
  for Compartments. Deferred with Compartments.
- **Compartment confinement of eval'd code** — `--allow=eval` runs
  eval'd source in the realm itself, not a sandbox (see "The eval
  engine"). True SES Compartment confinement (endowment-only globals)
  is deferred with Compartments.

## The eval engine (`--allow=eval`)

Shipped behind the `--allow=eval` gate (`realm.allow_eval`, default
false). With the gate closed Cynic refuses runtime code construction:
§19.2.1.2 HostEnsureCanCompileStrings throws an `EvalError` (the spec
leaves the error type host-defined; `EvalError` matches Node's
`--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` and browser CSP). A genuine
parse failure *after* the gate opens is a `SyntaxError` instead — the
two are distinct (capability refusal vs parse outcome). With the gate
open the following run for real:

- **`eval(x)` — §19.2.1.** Indirect eval (`(0, eval)(s)`,
  `globalThis.eval(s)`) evaluates `s` as global-scope code through the
  existing `evaluateEval` pipeline. Direct eval (the syntactic
  `eval(...)` form) is detected at compile time and lowered to a
  dedicated `direct_eval` opcode that captures a snapshot of the
  caller's visible env-slot bindings; at runtime the eval'd source is
  compiled against a synthetic outer scope rebuilt from that snapshot
  and run in a frame whose environment is parented to the caller's, so
  free identifiers resolve against the caller's locals and the eval
  inherits the caller's `this` / `new.target` / home object. A
  non-string argument is returned unchanged (§19.2.1 step 2). The
  runtime re-checks that the callee is actually `%eval%`, so a
  reassigned `globalThis.eval` is an ordinary call, not a direct eval.
- **`Function` / `GeneratorFunction` / `AsyncFunction` /
  `AsyncGeneratorFunction` string constructors — §20.2.1.1.1
  CreateDynamicFunction.** Implemented by source synthesis: the
  parameter strings + body are wrapped in a parenthesized function
  expression with the kind's prefix and run through `evaluateEval`, so
  the new function's scope is the global environment per spec.

**Strict-only parsing; spec-faithful variable-environment selection.** Cynic
parses every eval source with its strict-only grammar. For **direct** eval,
§19.2.1.1 sets `strictEval = strictCaller OR IsStrict(body)`; every Cynic caller
is strict, so top-level `var` and function declarations stay eval-local while
free identifiers can read the caller's scope.

For **indirect** eval, `strictEval` follows the body's Use Strict Directive for
the §19.2.1.3 declaration target even though the parser still accepts only
strict-compatible syntax. A body without `"use strict"` binds top-level `var`
and function declarations on the realm's global environment, with
§9.1.1.4.15/.16 `CanDeclareGlobalVar` / `CanDeclareGlobalFunction` checks and
deletable eval declarations. A body with `"use strict"` keeps those bindings
eval-local. Sloppy-only syntax and behavior (`with`, legacy delete semantics,
and undeclared assignment creating a global) remain deliberate strict-only
divergences. `ShadowRealm.prototype.evaluate` uses Script evaluation and is
unaffected.

**Posture interaction.** The eval engine is posture-agnostic; the
realm's existing freeze state does the confinement. Under the hardened
default, eval'd code sees the frozen primordials + override-mistake
fix — so `eval("Array.prototype.push = 1")` throws, and that freeze
*is* the confinement Cynic can offer pre-Compartments. Under
`--unhardened` the same eval'd code sees mutable primordials. No fake
endowment / confinement layer is built; full SES Compartment
confinement is deferred (see "Out of scope").

**test262.** The harness scores every fixture binary pass/fail under
a single posture — `--unhardened --allow=eval` (`realm.hardened =
false`, `realm.allow_eval = true`) — so the eval surface (~2,100
fixtures) runs for real and any eval-surface miss counts as a plain
`failing`, same as an engine bug. There is no eval-off "correctly
handled" reclassification. See `test262-results.md` and AGENTS.md
"Build & test" for the full picture of the scoring model.

**Default-off is a permanent, intentional divergence.** `eval` /
`Function(string)` / `Async`/`GeneratorFunction` refusing by default is
a deliberate, terminal design choice, not a stop-gap — the same class of
default-non-conformance Cynic already carries for Annex B and sloppy
mode. The spec (§19.2.1, §20.2.1.1, §27.5.1.1, §27.7.1.1) defines these
as callable with no host-refusal branch outside the gate, and every
shipping engine (V8 / Node, JSC, SpiderMonkey, QuickJS) runs them by
default; Cynic's hardened-by-default posture overrides that, the same
way it ships strict-only and Annex-B-out. Three points settle the
question (tracked as issue #25):

- **Conformance scoring is not affected.** The test262 harness self-sets
  `realm.allow_eval = true` (the scored `--unhardened --allow=eval`
  posture above), so the ~2,100 eval-surface fixtures already run for
  real. Default-off costs zero test262 points.
- **A `--conformance` mode that flips only eval would be redundant**
  with the existing `--allow=eval`, and a *true* conformance mode is
  incompatible with Cynic's strict-only / Annex-B-out target (it would
  have to re-enable sloppy mode and Annex B), so there is nothing
  coherent for it to mean here.
- **`--allow=eval` is the documented escape hatch** for an embedder or
  user who genuinely needs runtime code construction, and it runs the
  real engine described above.

So Cynic does **not** claim default-configuration conformance on this
surface and will not flip the default. Users who want spec-default eval
pass `--allow=eval`; everyone else gets the hardened posture.

## Verification

- `zig build test` for the full unit suite.
- `zig build test-ses` for hardened-default positive coverage.
- `zig build test262 -- --quiet` for the scored unhardened/eval-enabled
  conformance posture.
- `zig build bench` after primordial or synthetic-accessor changes.
- New unit tests pinning:
  - `Object.freeze` semantics on intrinsics (Phase 1)
  - `harden()` on cyclic and deep structures (Phase 2 — shipped)
  - Override shadowing via assignment + Reflect.set + spread (Phase 3)
  - `--unhardened` actually disables every gated piece (Phase 4)
- Manual smoke tests should cover both default-hardened behavior and the
  `--unhardened` opt-out.

## Abort criteria

Pull the change at any phase where:

1. Test262 default-mode sweep regresses by >150 fixtures and the
   regressions don't cluster around a single fixable mistake
2. The Phase 3 accessor-pair design causes a >15 % perf regression
   on `prop_access` (the IC has to optimize the synthetic getter
   case — if it can't, redesign or abandon the override-mistake fix)
3. A user-facing brand survey shows the SES-by-default messaging
   isn't resonating (this is a brand bet; if the market signal is
   clearly against, revisit)
